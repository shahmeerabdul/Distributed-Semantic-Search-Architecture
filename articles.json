DDoS MeaningWhat is a DDoS Attack? DDoS Meaning There are numerous cyber threats that internet users and network administrators need to be wary of, but for organizations whose services largely function online, one of the most important attacks to be aware of, due to their increasing prevalence - is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. But what is a denial-of-service attack, how do they work, and are there ways to prevent them? Distributed Denial of Service: A definition So, what is the meaning of DDoS? Sometimes called Distributed Network Attacks, this type of cyberattack takes advantage of the specific capacity limits that apply to any network resources – such as the infrastructure that enables a company’s website. The DDoS attack will send multiple requests to the attacked web resource – with the aim of exceeding the website’s capacity to handle multiple requests and prevent the website from functioning correctly. Typical targets for DDoS attacks include e-commerce sites and any organization offering online services. How does DDoS Work? An essential part of understanding DDoS attacks is learning how these attacks work. Network resources – such as web servers – have a finite limit to the number of requests that they can service simultaneously. In addition to the capacity limit of the server, the channel that connects the server to the Internet will also have a finite bandwidth or capacity. Whenever the number of requests exceeds the capacity limits of any component of the infrastructure, the level of service is likely to suffer. Usually, the attacker’s aim in any DDoS attack example is to overwhelm the web resource’s server, preventing normal function and resulting in a total denial-of-service. The attacker may also request payment for stopping the attack. In some cases, a DDoS attack may even be an attempt to discredit or damage a competitor’s business. To carry out the attack, the attacker seizes control of a network or device by infecting it with malware, creating a botnet. They then initiate the attack by sending specific instructions to the bots. In turn, the botnet begins issuing requests to the target server through its IP address, overwhelming it and causing the denial-of-service to its regular traffic. DDoS Attack Examples: What are the different types of attacks? Learning the DDoS meaning and how these attacks work is one step in preventing them, but it’s also crucial to understand that there are different types of DDoS attacks. This hinges on first outlining how network connections are formed. The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, developed by the International Organization for Standardization, defines seven distinct layers that make up internet network connections. These include the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer. The many DDoS attack examples differ by which connection layer they target. Below are some of the most common examples. Application layer attacks Sometimes called a layer 7 attack (because it targets the 7th (application) layer of the OSI model), these attacks exhaust the target server’s resources using DDoS websites. The 7th layer is where a server generates webpages in response to an HTTP request. Attackers execute numerous HTTP requests, overwhelming the target server as it responds by loading the numerous files and running the database queries required to create a web page. HTTP flood Think of these DDoS attacks as refreshing a web browser numerous times on many computers. This creates a “flood’ of HTTP requests, forcing a denial-of-service. The implementation of these attacks can be simple – using one URL with a narrow range of IP addresses – or complex, using an array of IP addresses and random URLs. Protocol attacks Often called state-exhaustion attacks, these DDoS attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the 3rd and 4th layers of the OSI model (the network and transport layers). These attacks create a denial-of-service by overwhelming server resources or network equipment resources, such as firewalls. There are several types of protocol attacks, including SYN floods. These exploit the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) handshake, which allows two to establish a network connection, sending an unmanageable number of TCP “Initial Connection Requests” from fake IP addresses. Volumetric attacks These DDoS attack examples create a denial-of-service by using all the available bandwidth on a target server by sending huge amounts of data to create a surge in traffic on the server. DNS amplification This is a reflection-based attack where a request is sent to a DNS server from a spoofed IP address (the target server’s), prompting the DNS server to “call” the target back to verify the request. This action is amplified by using a botnet, quickly overwhelming the target server’s resources. Identifying a DDoS attack DDoS attacks can be difficult to identify because they may mimic conventional service issues and are increasingly sophisticated. However, there are certain signs that may suggest that a system or network has fallen victim to a DDoS attack. Some of these may include: A sudden surge in traffic originating from an unknown IP address A flood of traffic from numerous users who share specific similarities, like geolocation or web browser version An inexplicable increase in requests for a single page Unusual traffic patterns Slow network performance A service or website that suddenly goes offline for no reason DDoS attack prevention and mitigation While DDoS attacks can be challenging to detect, it is possible to implement several measures to try to prevent these types of cyberattacks and mitigate any damage in case of an attack. For users wondering how to prevent DDoS attacks, the key is to create an action plan for securing systems and mitigating damage in case of an attack. In general, it is beneficial to implement a solution like Kaspersky DDoS protection for businesses, which continuously analyses and redirects malicious traffic. Additionally, the following general advice can help further enhance your defenses: Assess the current system setup - including software, devices, servers, and networks - to identify security risks and potential threats, then implement measures to reduce these; conduct regular risk assessments. Keep all software and technology up to date to ensure they’re running the latest security patches. Develop a viable strategy for DDoS attack prevention, detection and mitigation. Ensure anyone involved in the attack prevention plan understands the DDoS attack meaning and their assigned roles. In case of an attack, these actions may offer some mitigation: Anycast networks: Using an Anycast network to redistribute the traffic can help maintain server usability while the issue is being addressed, ensuring the server doesn’t need to be shut down completely. Black hole routing: In this scenario, a network administrator of the ISP reroutes all traffic from the target server into a black hole route (targeted IP address), dropping it from the network and preserving its integrity. However, this can be an extreme step to take as it also blocks legitimate traffic. Rate limiting: This limits how many requests a server can accept at any time. While it won’t be highly effective on its own, it can be useful as part of a larger strategy. Firewalls: Organizations can use Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to act as a reverse proxy to protect its servers. WAFs can be set with rules to filter traffic, and administrators can modify this in real time if they suspect a DDoS attack.

Similar to other cybercrimes like swatting, DDoS attacks disrupt normal operations and can cause significant harm to individuals and organizations Motivations for carrying out a DDoS vary widely, as do the types of individuals and organizations eager to perpetrate this form of cyberattack. Some attacks are carried out by disgruntled individuals and hacktivists wanting to take down a company's servers simply to make a statement, have fun by exploiting cyber weakness, or express disapproval. Other distributed denial-of-service attacks are financially motivated, such as a competitor disrupting or shutting down another business's online operations to steal business away in the meantime. Others involve extortion, in which perpetrators attack a company and install hostageware or ransomware on their servers, then force them to pay a large financial sum for the damage to be reversed. DDoS attacks are on the rise, and even some of the largest global companies are not immune to being \"DDoS'ed\". In cyber warfare campaigns, DDoS attacks can also be used by nation-states to disrupt critical infrastructure and weaken public trust. The largest attack in history occurred in February 2020 to none other than Amazon Web Services (AWS), overtaking an earlier attack on GitHub two years prior. DDoS ramifications include a drop in legitimate traffic, lost business, and reputation damage. As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to proliferate, as do the number of remote employees working from home, and so will the number of devices connected to a network. The security of each IoT device may not necessarily keep up, leaving the network to which it is connected vulnerable to attack. As such, the importance of DDoS protection and mitigation is crucial. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. Download Now How DDoS Attacks Work A DDoS attack aims to overwhelm the devices, services, and network of its intended target with fake internet traffic, rendering them inaccessible to or useless for legitimate users. DoS vs DDoS A distributed denial-of-service attack is a subcategory of the more general denial-of-service (DoS) attack. In a DoS attack, the attacker uses a single internet connection to barrage a target with fake requests or to try and exploit a cybersecurity vulnerability. DDoS is larger in scale. It utilizes thousands (even millions) of connected devices to fulfill its goal. The sheer volume of the devices used makes DDoS much harder to fight. Botnets Botnets are the primary way distributed denial-of-service-attacks are carried out. The attacker will hack into computers or other devices and install a malicious piece of code, or malware, called a bot. Together, the infected computers form a network called a botnet. The attacker then instructs the botnet to overwhelm the victim's servers and devices with more connection requests than they can handle. What Is DDoS Attack: Attack Symptoms And How To Identify One of the biggest issues with identifying a DDoS attack is that the symptoms are not unusual. Many of the symptoms are similar to what technology users encounter every day, including slow upload or download performance speeds, the website becoming unavailable to view, a dropped internet connection, unusual media and content, or an excessive amount of spam. In more severe cases, attackers may combine these disruptions with swatting threats to further intimidate and destabilize their targets. Further, a DDoS attack may last anywhere from a few hours to a few months, and the degree of attack can vary. Types Of DDoS Attacks Different attacks target different parts of a network, and they are classified according to the network connection layers they target. A connection on the internet is comprised of seven different “layers,\" as defined by the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model created by the International Organization for Standardization. The model allows different computer systems to be able to \"talk\" to each other. Volume-based or volumetric attacks This type of attack aims to control all available bandwidth between the victim and the larger internet. Domain name system (DNS) amplification is an example of a volume-based attack. In this scenario, the attacker spoofs the target's address, then sends a DNS name lookup request to an open DNS server with the spoofed address. When the DNS server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead to the target, resulting in the target receiving an amplification of the attacker’s initially small query. Protocol attacks Protocol attacks consume all available capacity of web servers or other resources, such as firewalls. They expose weaknesses in Layers 3 and 4 of the OSI protocol stack to render the target inaccessible. A SYN flood is an example of a protocol attack, in which the attacker sends the target an overwhelming number of transmission control protocol (TCP) handshake requests with spoofed source Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The targeted servers attempt to respond to each connection request, but the final handshake never occurs, overwhelming the target in the process. Application-layer attacks These attacks also aim to exhaust or overwhelm the target's resources but are difficult to flag as malicious. Often referred to as a Layer 7 DDoS attack—referring to Layer 7 of the OSI model—an application-layer attack targets the layer where web pages are generated in response to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests. A server runs database queries to generate a web page. In this form of attack, the attacker forces the victim's server to handle more than it normally does. An HTTP flood is a type of application-layer attack and is similar to constantly refreshing a web browser on different computers all at once. In this manner, the excessive number of HTTP requests overwhelms the server, resulting in a DDoS. DDoS Attack Prevention Even if you know what is a DDoS attack, It is extremely difficult to avoid attacks because detection is a challenge. This is because the symptoms of the attack may not vary much from typical service issues, such as slow-loading web pages, and the level of sophistication and complexity of DDoS techniques continues to grow. Further, many companies welcome a spike in internet traffic, especially if the company recently launched new products or services or announced market-moving news. As such, prevention is not always possible, so it is best for an organization to plan a response for when these attacks occur. DDoS Mitigation Once a suspected attack is underway, an organization has several options to mitigate its effects. Risk assessment Organizations should regularly conduct risk assessments and audits on their devices, servers, and network. While it is impossible to completely avoid a DDoS, a thorough awareness of both the strengths and vulnerabilities of the organization's hardware and software assets goes a long way. Knowing the most vulnerable segments of an organization's network is key to understanding which strategy to implement to lessen the damage and disruption that a DDoS attack can impose. Traffic differentiation If an organization believes it has just been victimized by a DDoS, one of the first things to do is determine the quality or source of the abnormal traffic. Of course, an organization cannot shut off traffic altogether, as this would be throwing out the good with the bad. As a mitigation strategy, use an Anycast network to scatter the attack traffic across a network of distributed servers. This is performed so that the traffic is absorbed by the network and becomes more manageable. Black hole routing Another form of defense is black hole routing, in which a network administrator—or an organization's internet service provider—creates a black hole route and pushes traffic into that black hole. With this strategy, all traffic, both good and bad, is routed to a null route and essentially dropped from the network. This can be rather extreme, as legitimate traffic is also stopped and can lead to business loss. Rate limiting Another way to mitigate DDoS attacks is to limit the number of requests a server can accept within a specific time frame. This alone is generally not sufficient to fight a more sophisticated attack but might serve as a component of a multipronged approach. Firewalls To lessen the impact of an application-layer or Layer 7 attack, some organizations opt for a Web Application Firewall (WAF). A WAF is an appliance that sits between the internet and a company's servers and acts as a reverse proxy. As with all firewalls, an organization can create a set of rules that filter requests. They can start with one set of rules and then modify them based on what they observe as patterns of suspicious activity carried out by the DDoS. Protect your network with FortiGate Firewalls.

DDoS Protection Solution A fully robust DDoS protection solution includes elements that help an organization in both defense and monitoring. As the sophistication and complexity level of attacks continue to evolve, companies need a solution that can assist them with both known and zero-day attacks. A DDoS protection solution should employ a range of tools that can defend against every type of DDoS attack and monitor hundreds of thousands of parameters simultaneously.

Phishing is a type of cyberattack that uses fraudulent emails, text messages, phone calls or websites to trick people into sharing sensitive data, downloading malware or otherwise exposing themselves to cybercrime. Phishing attacks are a form of social engineering. Unlike other cyberattacks that directly target networks and resources, social engineering attacks use human error, fake stories and pressure tactics to manipulate victims into unintentionally harming themselves or their organizations. In a typical phishing scam, a hacker pretends to be someone the victim trusts, like a colleague, boss, authority figure or representative of a well-known brand. The hacker sends a message directing the victim to pay an invoice, open an attachment, click a link or take some other action. Because they trust the supposed source of the message, the user follows the instructions and falls right into the scammer's trap. That \"invoice\" might lead directly to a hacker's account. That attachment might install ransomware on the user's device. That link might take the user to a website that steals credit card numbers, bank account numbers, login credentials or other personal data. Why phishing is a major cyberthreat Phishing is popular among cybercriminals and highly effective. According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach report, phishing is the most common data breach vector, accounting for 15% of all breaches. Breaches caused by phishing cost organizations an average of USD 4.88 million. Phishing is a significant threat because it exploits people rather than technological vulnerabilities. Attackers don't need to breach systems directly or outsmart cybersecurity tools. They can trick people who have authorized access to their target—be it money, sensitive information or something else—into doing their dirty work. Phishers can be lone scammers or sophisticated criminal gangs. They can use phishing for many malicious ends, including identity theft, credit card fraud, monetary theft, extortion, account takeovers, espionage and more. Phishing targets range from everyday people to major corporations and government agencies. In one of the most well-known phishing attacks, Russian hackers used a fake password-reset email to steal thousands of emails from Hillary Clinton's 2016 US presidential campaign.1 Because phishing scams manipulate human beings, standard network monitoring tools and techniques cannot always catch these attacks in progress. In fact, in the Clinton campaign attack, even the campaign's IT help desk thought the fraudulent password-reset emails were authentic. To combat phishing, organizations must combine advanced threat detection tools with robust employee education to ensure that users can accurately identify and safely respond to scam attempts. Types of phishing attacks The word \"phishing\" plays on the fact that scammers use attractive \"lures\" to trick their victims, much the same way that fishers use bait to hook actual fish. In phishing, the lures are fraudulent messages that appear credible and evoke strong emotions like fear, greed and curiosity. The kinds of lures phishing scammers use depend on whom and what they are after. Some common examples of phishing attacks include: Bulk email phishing In bulk email phishing, scammers indiscriminately send spam emails to as many people as possible, hoping that a fraction of the targets fall for the attack. Scammers often create emails that appear to come from large, legitimate businesses, such as banks, online retailers or the makers of popular apps. By impersonating well-known brands, scammers increase the chances that their targets are customers of those brands. If a target regularly interacts with a brand, they are more likely to open a phishing email that purports to come from that brand. Cybercriminals go to great lengths to make phishing emails appear genuine. They might use the impersonated sender's logo and branding. They might spoof email addresses to make it seem like the message comes from the impersonated sender's domain name. They might even copy a genuine email from the impersonated sender and modify it for malicious ends. Scammers write email subject lines to appeal to strong emotions or create a sense of urgency. Savvy scammers use subjects that the impersonated sender might actually address, such as \"Problem with your order\" or \"Your invoice is attached.\" The body of the email instructs the recipient to take a seemingly reasonable action that results in divulging sensitive information or downloading malware. For example, a phishing link might read, \"Click here to update your profile.\" When the victim clicks that malicious link, it takes them to a fake website that steals their login credentials. Some scammers time their phishing campaigns to align with holidays and other events where people are more susceptible to pressure. For example, phishing attacks on Amazon customers often spike around Prime Day, the online retailer's annual sales event.2 Scammers send emails about fake deals and payment problems to take advantage of people's lowered guards. Spear phishing Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack on a specific individual. The target is usually someone with privileged access to sensitive data or special authority that the scammer can exploit, such as a finance manager who can move money from company accounts. A spear phisher studies their target to gather the information they need to pose as someone the target trusts, such as a friend, boss, coworker, vendor or financial institution. Social media and professional networking sites—where people publicly congratulate coworkers, endorse vendors and tend to overshare—are rich sources of information for spear phishing research. Spear phishers use their research to craft messages that contain specific personal details, making them seem highly credible to the target. For example, a spear phisher might pose as the target's boss and send an email that reads: \"I know you're leaving tonight for vacation, but can you please pay this invoice before the close of business today?\" A spear phishing attack aimed at a C-level executive, wealthy individual or other high-value target is called a whale phishing or whaling attack. Business email compromise (BEC) BEC is a class of spear phishing attacks that attempt to steal money or valuable information—for example, trade secrets, customer data or financial information—from a business or other organization. BEC attacks can take several forms. Two of the most common include: CEO fraud: The scammer impersonates a C-level executive, often by hijacking the executive's email account. The scammer sends a message to a lower-level employee instructing them to transfer funds to a fraudulent account, make a purchase from a fraudulent vendor or send files to an unauthorized party. Email account compromise (EAC): The scammer compromises a lower-level employee's email account, such as the account of a manager in finance, sales or research and development. The scammer uses the account to send fraudulent invoices to vendors, instruct other employees to make fraudulent payments or request access to confidential data. BEC attacks can be among the costliest cyberattacks, with scammers often stealing millions of dollars at a time. In one notable example, a group of scammers stole more than USD 100 million from Facebook and Google by posing as a legitimate software vendor.3 Some BEC scammers are shifting away from these high-profile tactics in favor of launching small attacks against more targets. According to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), BEC attacks grew more frequent in 2023, but scammers asked for less money on average with each attack.4 Other phishing techniques Smishing SMS phishing, or smishing, uses fake text messages to trick targets. Scammers commonly pose as the victim's wireless provider, sending a text that offers a \"free gift\" or asks the user to update their credit card information. Some smishers pose as the US Postal Service or another shipping company. They send texts that tell victims they must pay a fee to receive a package they ordered. Vishing Voice phishing, or vishing, is phishing by phone call. Vishing incidents have exploded in recent years, increasing by 260% between 2022 and 2023 according to the APWG.5 The rise of vishing is partly due to the availability of voice over IP (VoIP) technology, which scammers can use to make millions of automated vishing calls per day. Scammers often use caller ID spoofing to make their calls appear to come from legitimate organizations or local phone numbers. Vishing calls typically scare recipients with warnings of credit card processing problems, overdue payments or trouble with the law. Recipients end up providing sensitive data or money to the cybercriminals to \"resolve\" their issues. Social media phishing Social media phishing employs social media platforms to trick people. Scammers use the platforms' built-in messaging capabilities—for example, Facebook Messenger, LinkedIn InMail and X (formerly Twitter) DMs—the same ways they use email and text messaging. Scammers often pose as users who need the target's help logging in to their account or winning a contest. They use this ruse to steal the target's login credentials and take over their account on the platform. These attacks can be especially costly to victims who use the same passwords across multiple accounts, an all-too-common practice. Think Newsletter Would your team catch the next zero-day in time?

Some recent developments include: AI phishing AI phishing uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to create phishing messages. These tools can generate tailored emails and text messages that lack spelling errors, grammatical inconsistencies and other common red flags of phishing attempts. Generative AI can also help scammers scale their operations. According to IBM’s X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, it takes a scammer 16 hours to craft a phishing email manually. With AI, scammers can create even more convincing messages in only five minutes. Scammers also use image generators and voice synthesizers to add further credibility to their schemes. For example, in 2019, attackers used AI to clone the voice of an energy company CEO and scam a bank manager out of USD 243,000.7 Quishing Quishing uses fake QR codes embedded in emails and text messages or posted in the real world. Quishing allows hackers to hide malicious websites and software in plain sight. For example, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned last year of a scam where criminals replace QR codes on public parking meters with their own codes that steal payment data.6 Hybrid vishing Hybrid vishing attacks combine voice phishing with other methods to evade spam filters and gain victims' trust. For example, a scammer might send an email purporting to come from the IRS. This email tells the target that there is a problem with their tax return. To resolve the issue, the target must call a phone number provided in the email, which connects them directly to the scammer.

New episodes on Wednesdays at 6am EST. Watch the latest podcast episode What are the signs of a phishing attack? Details can vary from scam to scam, but there are some common signs that indicate a message might be a phishing attempt. These signs include: Strong emotions and pressure tactics Phishing scams try to make victims feel a sense of urgency so that they act quickly without thinking. Scammers often do this by invoking strong emotions like fear, greed and curiosity. They might impose time limits and threaten unrealistic consequences, such as jail time. Common phishing ruses include: \"There is a problem with your account or financial information. You must update it immediately to avoid losing access.\" \"We have detected illegal activity. Pay this fine now, or else you will be arrested.\" \"You have won a free gift, but you must claim it right now.\" \"This invoice is overdue. You must pay it immediately, or we will shut off your service.\" \"We have an exciting investment opportunity for you. Deposit money now, and we can guarantee incredible returns.\" Requests for money or sensitive information Phishing scams typically ask for one of two things: money or data. Unsolicited or unexpected requests for payment or personal information can be signs of phishing attacks. Scammers disguise their requests for money as overdue invoices, fines or fees for services. They disguise requests for information as notices to update payment or account information or reset a password. Poor spelling and grammar Many phishing gangs operate internationally, which means they often write phishing messages in languages they do not speak fluently. Therefore, many phishing attempts contain grammatical errors and inconsistencies. Generic messaging Messages from legitimate brands often contain specific details. They might address customers by name, reference specific order numbers or explain precisely what the problem is. A vague message such as \"There is an issue with your account\" with no further details is a red flag. Fake URLs and email addresses Scammers often use URLs and email addresses that appear legitimate at first glance. For example, an email from \"admin@rnicrosoft.com\" might seem safe, but look again. The \"m\" in \"Microsoft\" is actually an \"r\" and an \"n.\" Another common tactic is using a URL like \"bankingapp.scamsite.com.\" A user might think this links to bankingapp.com, but it actually points to a subdomain of scamsite.com. Hackers might also use link-shortening services to disguise malicious URLs. Other signs Scammers might send files and attachments the target did not request for and does not expect. They might use images of text instead of actual text in messages and web pages to avoid spam filters. Some scammers reference hot-button issues to get victims riled up. For example, IBM® X-Force® found that scammers commonly use the conflict in Ukraine to stoke targets' emotions. Phishing prevention and mitigation Security awareness training and organizational policies Because phishing scams target people, employees are often an organization's first and last line of defense against these attacks. Organizations can teach users how to recognize the signs of phishing attempts and respond to suspicious emails and text messages. This can include giving employees easy ways to report phishing attempts to the IT or security team. Organizations can also establish policies and practices that make it harder for phishers to succeed. For example, organizations can forbid people from initiating monetary transfers over email. They can require employees to verify requests for money or information by contacting the requester through means other than those provided in the message. For example, employees can type a URL directly into their browser instead of clicking a link or call a colleague's office line instead of replying to a text from an unknown number. Antiphishing tools and technology Organizations can supplement employee training and company policies with security tools that help detect phishing messages and thwart hackers who use phishing to break into networks. Spam filters and email security software use data on existing phishing scams and machine learning algorithms to identify phishing emails and other spam messages. The scams and spam are then moved to a separate folder, where malicious links and code are eradicated. Antivirus and antimalware software can detect and neutralize malicious files or code carried by phishing emails. Multifactor authentication can prevent hackers from taking over user accounts. Phishers can steal passwords, but they have a much harder time stealing a second factor like a fingerprint scan or one-time passcode. Endpoint security tools like endpoint detection and response (EDR) and unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions can use artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics to intercept phishing attempts and block malware. Web filters prevent users from visiting known malicious websites and display alerts whenever users visit suspicious pages. These tools can help mitigate damage if a user clicks a phishing link. Enterprise cybersecurity solutions, such as security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) and security information and event management (SIEM) platforms, use AI and automation to detect and respond to anomalous activity. These solutions can help stop phishers who are attempting to install malware or take over accounts. Techsplainers | Podcast | What is phishing? Listen to: 'What is phishing?'

Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a legitimate and reputable source, usually through email and text messaging. The attacker's goal is to steal money, gain access to sensitive data and login information, or to install malware on the victim's device. Phishing is a dangerous, damaging, and an increasingly common type of cyberattack. Read Phishing for Dummies Stop and block phishing attacks How does phishing work? Phishing works by luring a victim with legitimate-looking (but fraudulent) emails or other communication from a trusted (or sometimes seemingly desperate) sender who coaxes victims into providing confidential information—often on what looks to be a convincingly legitimate website. Sometimes malware or ransomware is also downloaded onto the victim's computer. Who are the targets of phishing? Anyone. Most phishing attacks target numerous email addresses with the hope that some percentage of users will be tricked. Security awareness training is helpful in educating users on the dangers of phishing attacks and teaches strategies to identify phishing communications. Why are phishing attacks so effective? Phishing is effective because it exploits the vulnerabilities of human nature, including a tendency to trust others, act out of curiosity, or respond emotionally to urgent messages. And phishing attacks are increasingly easy to perpetrate with phishing kits readily available on the dark web. It's a relatively low-risk pursuit for attackers, with bulk email addresses easy to obtain and emails virtually free to send. How do phishing scams trick users? A phishing attack relies on a social-engineering effort where hackers create a counterfeit communication that looks legitimate and appears to come from a trusted source. Attackers use seemingly benign emails or text messages to trick unsuspecting users into taking an action such as downloading malware, visiting an infected site, or divulging login credentials in order to steal money or data. Phishers frequently use tactics like fear, curiosity, a sense of urgency, and greed to compel recipients to open attachments or click on links.Phishing attacks are designed to appear to come from legitimate companies and individuals.Cybercriminals are continuously innovating and using increasingly sophisticated techniques, including spear phishing (an attack directed at a specific person or group) and other strategies, to trick users into clicking or tapping.It only takes one successful phishing attack to compromise your network and steal your data, which is why it is always important to Think Before You Click (PDF). (You can click that link, as it has important phishing stats and information.) Why do hackers send phishing scams? Motivations for phishing attacks differ, but mainly attackers are seeking valuable user data such as personally identifiable information (PII) or login credentials that can be used to commit fraud by accessing the victim's financial accounts. Once attackers have login information, personal data, access to online accounts, or credit card data, they can obtain permissions to modify or compromise more cloud-connected systems and in some cases, hijack entire computer networks until the victim pays a ransom. Some cybercriminals aren't satisfied with merely getting your personal data and credit card information. They won't stop until they have drained your bank account. In these cases, they may go beyond emails and use \"popup phishing\" combined with voice phishing (vishing) and SMS text messages (SMiShing). Victims may be frightened into divulging bank account access information and other details. Often perpetrated against elderly individuals or people in targeted organizations' finance departments, vishing and SMiShing are types of cyberattacks that everyone should learn about to protect themselves and their financial security. What can happen when you are phished? The danger of phishing can include both personal and professional risks. Personal phishing risks include: Money stolen from your bank accountFraudulent charges on credit cardsLost access to photos, videos, and filesFake social media posts made in your accountsCybercriminals impersonating you, putting friends or family members at risk At work, phishing risks include: Loss of corporate fundsExposing personal information of partners, coworkers, and customersFiles becoming locked and inaccessibleDamage to your organization's reputation AI and phishing Phishing is evolving with AI The first primitive forms of phishing attacks emerged decades ago in chat rooms. Since then, phishing has evolved in complexity to become one of the largest and most costly cybercrimes on the internet that leads to business email compromise (BEC), email account takeover (ATO), and ransomware. In fact, Tom Gillis, Cisco SVP and General Manager of Infrastructure and Security, noted during his RSA Conference keynote that 80% of ransomware attacks observed by Cisco started with a phishing email. More recently, AI has made it easier for attackers to carry out sophisticated and targeted attacks by correcting spelling mistakes and personalizing messaging. For example, cybercriminals collect identifying information on groups or individuals they want to target and then use that information to mount highly personalized phishing campaigns called spear phishing. Because spear phishing communications are much more personalized, they can look especially legitimate, and thus are even more dangerous. On the other hand, AI security solutions are enabling advanced detection and prevention techniques. Now Cisco Secure products leverage predictive and generative AI that expands our reach and interaction with security touchpoints. Cisco Secure Email Threat Defense uses unique artificial intelligence and machine learning models, including natural language processing (NLP), to identify malicious techniques used in attacks targeting your organization, derive unparalleled context for specific business risks, provide searchable threat telemetry, and categorize threats to understand which parts of your organization are most vulnerable to attack. Watch now (08:03) Phishing awareness How your organization can increase phishing awareness It's important to adopt a multilayered approach that includes email filters and employee awareness training. If an attack makes it through your security defenses, employees are typically the last line of defense. Build security resilience by learning how to recognize phishing attacks, prevent them, and remediate them if you ever accidentally succumb to a phishing attack. Start by testing your phishing knowledge with our Phishing Awareness Quiz. Phishing prevention: what is the best defense against phishing? No single cybersecurity solution can avert all phishing attacks. Your organization should deploy cybersecurity technology and take a tiered security approach to reduce the number of phishing attacks and the impact when attacks do occur. To learn about the latest phishing attack methods, including spear phishing, typosquatting, steganography, and how to combat them with advanced cybersecurity methods, download our e-book, Phishing for Dummies, and see Chapter 1: Phishing 101. Deploy tiered security solutions Your organization can deploy Cisco Umbrella for phishing protection and Cisco Secure Email Threat Defense to safeguard inboxes. Organizations may also consider Cisco Secure Access, a cloud-delivered security service edge (SSE) solution, grounded in zero trust, that provides secure access from anything to anywhere, including phishing protection. A strong MFA solution, like Cisco Duo, can also deter would-be attackers who have stolen login credentials through phishing. Conduct regular training Phishing training and anti-phishing strategies will help enlist employees in efforts to defend your organization. Include Cisco Secure Awareness Training as part of this approach. Phishing simulations and awareness training help you educate users on how to spot and report phishing attempts. Avoid posting contact information online Some attackers collect info by scraping information from these social media and websites. They collect mobile numbers for key stakeholders from email signatures and use that information for spear phishing and SMiShing campaigns. Develop unique email address conventions Common email address naming conventions are shared on the open internet and most patterns are easy to guess. Consider developing an email naming convention that doesn't follow the standard first name (dot) last name or the first-initial, last-name pattern. Randomizing email names across the organization will make them impossible to guess on a mass scale. Deploy secure messaging platforms With email remaining the number one vector for phishing attacks, many organizations are turning to the security of messaging platforms, including Cisco Webex Messaging for internal communication. Messaging platforms reduce the overall dependency on email for communication and in turn reduces email volume. When combined with anti-phishing training, this approach gives employees more time and ability to detect fraudulent emails. How to detect phishingYou can learn how to detect phishing emails on desktop and mobile devices. Some basic steps for detecting phishing emails follow below. On any email client You can examine hypertext links, which is one of the best ways to recognize a phishing attack. Look for misspellings and grammatical errors in the body of the email. Check that the domain the email was sent from is spelled correctly. For example, in phishing emails you'll often find a number used instead of a letter. Check hyperlinks in emails In a browser,the destination URL will show in a hover-popup window for the hyperlink. Ensure that the destination URL link equals what is in the email. Additionally, be cautious about clicking links that have strange characters in them or are abbreviated. On mobile devices You can observe the destination URL by briefly holding your finger over the hyperlink. The URL preview will materialize in a small popup window. On web pages Hover over the anchor text to find the destination URL revealed in the bottom-left corner of the browser window. Check your phish spotting skills Individuals can follow additional phishing safety steps: Don't click email links from unknown sourcesKeep your browser updatedMonitor your online accounts regularlyBe aware of pop-up windowsNever give out personal information over emailBe aware of text messages and phone calls from unknown personsBe way of social and emotional luresDeploy malicious URL detection and content filteringTrack the latest phishing attacks with advanced phishing protectionTake our phishing quiz as part of your phishing education Most common types of phishing attacks Business email compromise (BEC) BEC attacks are carefully planned and researched attacks that impersonate an organizational executive vendor or supplier. Watch Phish and Learn to see why BEC is difficult to detect View business email compromise (BEC) infographic (PDF) There are a number of phishing threats related to BEC. Email account compromise. This is a common type of BEC scam in which an employee's email account is hacked and used to request payments from vendors. The money is then sent to attacker-controlled bank accounts. Employee impersonation. This type of BEC takes the form of an email scam, in which a bad actor impersonates a trusted internal employee or vendor to steal money or sensitive information through email. VIP impersonation. This type of attack occurs when a malicious actor sends an email to an unsuspecting victim, using a compromised email of a legitimate company, individual or VIP, asking for payment or funds transfer. External payment fraud. An email attack is sent to an unsuspecting victim impersonating trusted vendors for invoice payment requests. It is also known as Vendor Email Compromise (VEC). Internal payment fraud. Using stolen credentials an attacker can gain access to internal payment systems such as payment platforms and set up fraudulent vendors, change payment recipients, or redirect payments to their accounts. Payroll diversion fraud. Using stolen email credentials, an attacker emails an organization's payroll or finance department requesting a change to direct-deposit information. Social engineering. Persuasion through psychology is used to gain a target's trust, causing them to lower their guard and take unsafe action such as divulging personal information. Extortion. Threatening or intimidating action is used to obtain monetary or other financial gain, commonly used in vishing scams. Malicious recon emails. This looks like legitimate email communication but is actually an email sent by an attacker with the purpose of eliciting a response prior to extracting sensitive user or organizational data. Credential phishing. A bad actor steals login credentials by posing as a legitimate entity using emails and fake login pages. The bad actor then uses the victim's stolen credentials to carry out a secondary attack or extract data. Account takeover (ATO) The methods used by attackers to gain access to cloud email, such as a Microsoft 365 email account, are fairly simple and increasingly common. These phishing campaigns usually take the form of a fake email from Microsoft. The email contains a request to log in, stating the user needs to reset their password, hasn't logged in recently, or that there's a problem with the account that needs their attention. A URL is included, enticing the user to click to remedy the issue. Watch Phish and Learn to understand how ATO occurs Blog: Spotting fake Office 365 emails Spear phishing Spear phishing targets specific individuals instead of a wide group of people. That way, the attackers can customize their communications and appear more authentic. Spear phishing is often the first step used to penetrate a company's defenses and carry out a targeted attack. According to the SANS Institute, 95 percent of all attacks on enterprise networks are the result of successful spear phishing. Tips to stop phishing (PDF) Whaling When attackers go after a \"big fish\" like a CEO, it's called whaling. These attackers often spend considerable time profiling the target to find the opportune moment and means to steal login credentials. Whaling is of particular concern because high-level executives have access to a great deal of sensitive organizational information. Voice phishing (vishing) Voice phishing, or vishing, is a form of social engineering. It is a fraudulent phone call or voice message designed to obtain sensitive information such as login credentials. For instance, the attacker might call pretending to be a support agent or representative of your organization or a subscription service. New employees are often vulnerable to these types of scams, but they can happen to anyone—and are becoming more common. Deploying spam call-blocking software is a common tactic to prevent these types of calls. SMS phishing (SMiShing) Text message, or SMS phishing, can come through random broadcast text messages or portray a known coworker in your organization. Sometimes SMIShing messages contain a link or can request you to take immediate action. Either way, if you don't recognize the mobile number, delete the message. If you are ever unsure, call the individual using a valid phone number to make sure the task is legitimate. Angler phishing Angler phishing is similar to vishing, but instead of a phone call, attackers reach out by direct messaging on social media platforms. Victims are targeted by fake customer service agents. These attacks have even tricked professional anti-scammers, so don't underestimate the efficacy of this method. As phishing has evolved, it has taken on a variety of names—including spear phishing, smishing—and phishing attacks come through a variety of channels, including compromised websites, social media, fake ads, QR codes, attachments and text messages.

What Is Phishing? 2024 State of the Phish Report Download the Proofpoint Email Protection Data Sheet Phishing is a common type of cyber-attack that targets individuals through email, text messages, phone calls, and other forms of communication. A phishing attack aims to trick the recipient into falling for the attacker’s desired action, such as revealing financial information, system login credentials, or other sensitive information. Fundamentally, these threats exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. As a popular form of social engineering, phishing uses psychological manipulation and deception whereby threat actors masquerade as reputable entities to mislead users into performing specific actions. These actions often involve clicking links to fake websites, downloading and installing malicious files, and divulging private information, like bank account numbers or credit card information. Since the mid-1990s, the term “phishing” has been used to identify hackers who use fraudulent emails to “fish for” information from unsuspecting users. However, phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and are now broken down into different types, including email phishing, spear phishing, smishing, vishing, and whaling. Each type is characterized by specific channels and methods of execution—email, text, voice, social media, etc.—all with a similar underlying intention of exploiting human trust and decision-making processes. Table of Contents How Phishing Works Why Is Phishing a Problem? Personal vs. Workplace Phishing Risks Phishing Examples Phishing Techniques Types of Phishing Attacks Most Targeted Industries Most Impersonated Brands How AI Is Evolving Phishing Phishing Prevention How AI Is Advancing Detection Phishing Protection What to Do If You’ve Fallen Victim Stay Vigilant with the Right Human-Centric Security Provider Phishing FAQs How Phishing Works A phishing campaign always starts with a malicious message disguised to look like it’s from a legitimate sender, usually a company. The more aspects of the message that mimic the real company, the more likely an attacker will be successful. While their goals may vary, attackers aim to steal personal information or credentials. An attack is facilitated by injecting a sense of urgency into the message by, for example, threatening account suspension, money loss, or loss of one’s job. Users tricked into an attacker’s demands typically don’t take the time to consider if the demands seem reasonable or if the source is legitimate. “Cyber criminals know that humans can be easily exploited, either through negligence, compromised identity—or in some instances—malicious intent,” said Ryan Kalember of Proofpoint. “Individuals play a central role in an organization’s security posture, with 74% of breaches still centering on the human element. While fostering a security culture is important, training alone is not a silver bullet. Knowing what to do and doing it are two different things.” It only takes one person to fall for a phishing attack to incite a severe data breach. That’s why it’s one of the most critical and challenging threats to mitigate, as it requires human defenses. Based on real-world threats from Proofpoint customers’ end users 24 million messages were reported, up from 18 million in 2022. 71% of organizations experienced at least one successful phishing attack in 2023. 9.3% of simulated phishing emails got users to click in 2023. $4.76 million is the average cost of data breaches due to phishing attacks. Over 1 million attacks are launched with the MFA-bypass framework EvilProxy every month, but 89% of security professionals believe MFA protects against account takeover. 73% of organizations reported a BEC attack, but only 29% teach users about such attacks. 71% of users took a risk action, and 96% of them didn’t know they were doing something risky. 32% of organizations experienced loss of data/intellectual property due to phishing attacks in 2023. 68 million malicious messages were associated with Microsoft products in 2023, making it the most abused brand by cybercriminals. Why Is Phishing a Problem? Phishing is a significant problem because it’s easy, cheap, and effective, making them widespread cyber-attacks. Victims of phishing scams may end up with malware infections (including ransomware), identity theft, and data loss. Unlike traditional security threats that target technical vulnerabilities, phishing directly exploits the human element of security—often the most vulnerable link in an organization’s security posture. Cyber criminals seek data rich with personal identifiable information (PII)—like financial account data, credit card numbers, and tax and medical records—as well as sensitive business data, such as customer names and contact information, proprietary product secrets, and confidential communications. According to Proofpoint’s research, over 90% of targeted attacks start with phishing emails crafted to appear legitimate to the specific recipients. Phishing is also used to gain direct access to email, social media, and other accounts and obtain permissions to modify and compromise connected systems, like point-of-sale terminals and order processing systems. A simple phishing email may gain enough of a foothold for a cyber criminal to build up to a major data breach. Personal vs. Workplace Phishing Risks In personal life, phishing risks often target individual financial accounts, social media profiles, and personal identity information. These attacks can lead to financial losses, identity theft, or compromised personal data. In the workplace, phishing poses broader risks, potentially compromising entire corporate networks, sensitive business data, and client information. A successful workplace phishing attack can result in significant financial damage, reputational harm, and legal consequences for the organization. While personal phishing mainly affects individuals, workplace phishing can have far-reaching impacts on multiple stakeholders, including employees, customers, and business partners. The human-centric nature of these attacks means that organizations must focus on both technical defenses and employee awareness training to create a comprehensive security culture. Phishing Examples Attackers prey on fear by creating a sense of urgency, often using strategies that tell users their account has been restricted or will be suspended if they don’t respond to the email. Because phishing attacks are typically sent to as many people as possible, the messaging is usually thin and generic. The following illustrates a common phishing email example. In the above message, the user’s name is not mentioned, and the sense of urgency tricks users into opening the attachment. The attachment could be a web page, a shell script (e.g., PowerShell), or a Microsoft Office document with a malicious macro. The macro and scripts can be used to download malware or trick users into divulging their account credentials. In some email phishing tactics, attackers register domains similar to their official counterparts or occasionally use generic email providers such as Gmail. The messages might contain the official company logo, but the sender’s address would not include the official company domain. How an attacker carries out a phishing campaign depends on their goals. Attackers may attach fake invoices to trick an organization’s accounts payable department into sending money. The button in this example opens a web page with a fraudulent Google authentication form. The page attempts to scam targeted victims into entering their Google credentials so that attackers can steal accounts. These social engineering tactics are designed to bypass technical security measures by manipulating the people who have legitimate access to systems and data. Phishing Techniques Cyber criminals use three primary phishing techniques to steal information: malicious web links, malicious attachments, and fraudulent data-entry forms. These techniques are designed to exploit human psychology and behavior, making them particularly effective in bypassing traditional security measures. Malicious Web Links Phishing links take users to impostor websites or sites infected with malicious software, known as malware. Malicious links can be disguised as trusted links and are embedded in logos and other images in an email. Here is an example of an email received by users at Cornell University, displaying “Help Desk” as the sender’s name. However, the email did not originate from the university’s help desk but from the @connect.ust.hk domain. The link embedded in the email points to a page that mirrors the Office 365 login page, attempting to steal user credentials. Malicious Attachments While these may look like legitimate file attachments, they are actually infected with malware that can compromise computers and their files. Here’s an example of a phishing email shared by international shipper FedEx on its website. This email encouraged recipients to print a copy of an attached postal receipt and take it to a FedEx location to get a parcel that could not be delivered. Unfortunately, the attachment contained a virus that infected the recipients’ computers. Variations of these shipping scams are prevalent during the holiday shopping season. Fraudulent Data Entry Forms These techniques use fake forms that prompt users to fill in sensitive information—such as user IDs, passwords, credit card data, and phone numbers. Cyber criminals use the submitted information for various fraudulent activities, including identity theft. Here’s an example of a fake landing page mimicking the gov.uk website. After clicking a link in a phishing email, users are routed to this fraudulent page that appears to be part of the HMRC tax collection agency. Users are told they are eligible for a refund but must complete the form first. The Ponemon 2021 Cost of Phishing Study Read the report Types of Phishing Attacks Phishing has evolved into more than simple credential and data theft. An attacker’s process depends on the following phishing types: Email phishing: The general term for any malicious email message meant to trick users into divulging private information. Attackers generally aim to steal account credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), and corporate trade secrets. However, attackers targeting a specific business might have other motives. Spear phishing: These email messages are sent to specific people within an organization, usually high-privilege account holders, to trick them into divulging sensitive data, sending the attacker money, or downloading malware. This hyper-targeted approach exploits the human tendency to trust communications that appear personalized and relevant. Link manipulation: Messages contain a link to a malicious site that looks like the official business but takes recipients to an attacker-controlled server where they are persuaded to authenticate into a spoofed login page that sends credentials to an attacker. Whaling (CEO fraud): These messages are typically sent to high-profile employees of a company to trick them into believing the CEO or other executive has requested a money transfer. However, be warned that “A CEO’s executive assistant is statistically more likely to be a very attacked person than a CEO,” Proofpoint’s Ryan Kalember told F1 Solutions. Content injection: An attacker who has injected malicious content into an official site tricks users into accessing the site to show them a malicious popup or redirect them to a phishing website. Malware: A clicked link or opened attachment might download malware onto devices. Ransomware, rootkits, or keyloggers are common malware attachments that steal data and extort payments from targeted victims. Smishing: Using SMS messages, attackers send a text message to a targeted victim with a malicious link that promises discounts, rewards, or free prizes. This technique exploits the increasing reliance on mobile devices and the quick, often less cautious way people interact with text messages. Vishing: Attackers use voice-changing software to leave a message telling targeted victims they must call a number where they can be scammed. Attackers also use voice changers when speaking to targeted victims to deceive them. “Evil Twin” Wi-Fi: Spoofing free Wi-Fi, attackers trick users into connecting to a malicious hotspot to perform man-in-the-middle exploits. Pharming: Pharming is a two-phase attack used to steal account credentials. The first phase installs malware on a targeted victim and redirects them to a browser and a spoofed website, where they are tricked into divulging credentials. DNS poisoning is also used to redirect users to spoofed domains. Angler phishing: Attackers reply to social media posts as an official organization to trick users into divulging account credentials and personal information. Watering hole: An attacker identifies a site numerous targeted users use, exploits a vulnerability, and uses it to trick users into downloading malware. With malware installed on targeted user machines, an attacker can redirect users to spoofed websites or deliver a payload to the local network to steal data. Most Targeted Industries The goal of most phishing attacks is financial gain, so attackers target specific industries and platforms that store payment data. However, these attacks primarily exploit the human element within these industries, targeting employees and customers with access to valuable systems and information. Below are some of the most targeted industries and sectors, according to the latest data from Statista: eCommerce/retail: With customers entering both personal and financial information during transactions, these platforms present a significant opportunity for data theft and account for 8% of phishing attacks. Common tactics include sending fake order confirmation emails containing malicious links. These attacks exploit customers’ anticipating order updates and trusting familiar brand communications. Social media: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other popular social platforms have become a hotbed for phishing, with 30% of attacks targeting these platforms. Cyber criminals exploit users’ trust in these platforms by creating fake profiles and sending malicious messages. Banks and other financial institutes: The financial sector remains the prime target for phishers, accounting for 13% of all phishing attacks. Banks, payment platforms, and other financial institutions handle massive amounts of sensitive personal data and have direct access to bank accounts, making them lucrative targets for cyber criminals. The nature of these threats often creates a sense of urgency around account security or financial opportunities. Payment systems (merchant card processors): Payment processors, reflecting 5.8% of all phishing attacks, are prime targets for cyber criminals due to the sensitive financial data they handle. Phishers often target employees to steal login credentials, potentially gaining access to vast amounts of financial information. Technology: The interconnected nature of tech companies makes them attractive targets for cyber criminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in the software supply chain. Alarmingly, 80% of reported cyber crimes in this sector are attributed to phishing attacks. These attacks often target technical employees with elevated access privileges, demonstrating that human-centric security is crucial even in highly technical environments. Telecommunication companies: Reflecting 4.9% of phishing attacks, telecom companies operate in a highly risk-laden environment due to the vast amount of customer data they hold. Successful phishing attacks on these companies could lead to service interruptions and potential leakage of sensitive customer information. The human factor is particularly important here, as employees often have access to multiple systems and customer accounts. Logistics and shipping: The logistics and shipping industry faces unique cybersecurity challenges due to its critical role in global supply chains. The widespread adoption of IoT devices in logistics has also created new entry points for cyber criminals, leading to 3.1% of phishing schemes. Healthcare companies: The healthcare sector, storing vast amounts of highly sensitive patient data, is particularly vulnerable to phishing attacks. The transition from paper to digital records has increased the industry’s exposure to such threats. Travel: The travel industry is vulnerable to phishing attacks targeting loyalty programs, attempting to steal points or miles with monetary value. Cyber criminals often create fake travel booking websites or send phishing emails with “too good to be true” deals to lure victims into providing personal and financial information. Most Impersonated Brands To exploit as many people as possible, attackers use well-known brands that recipients inherently trust, increasing their success. This strategy leverages the psychological principle of authority, as people are more likely to comply with requests from entities they recognize and respect. Specific company brands are consistently leveraged due to their widespread use and the valuable data associated with their accounts. As of early 2025, the most frequently impersonated brands in phishing attacks include: Microsoft Apple Google LinkedIn Alibaba WhatsApp Amazon Twitter Facebook Adobe Technology giants and social media platforms dominate the list, reflecting their vast user bases and the critical nature of the accounts they manage. E-commerce giant Alibaba has also entered the top ranks, indicating its growing global presence. During peak shopping seasons, luxury and popular retail brands like Nike, Adidas, and Lululemon see increased impersonation attempts. Cyber criminals often create fraudulent domains with phony sales and fake discounts to lure unsuspecting shoppers. These seasonal attacks demonstrate how threat actors adapt their human-centric targeting strategies based on predictable changes in consumer behavior and attention. How AI Is Evolving Phishing AI is revolutionizing phishing attacks, making them more sophisticated, personalized, and difficult to detect. This technological advancement is reshaping the cybersecurity landscape in several key ways: Hyper-Personalization AI-powered tools now enable attackers to craft highly tailored phishing emails by scraping and analyzing vast amounts of publicly available data. These messages can reference recent company news, mimic a colleague’s writing style, or even mention personal details gleaned from social media, making them incredibly convincing. “Threat actors are notorious for using current events to create enticing social-engineering lures,” said Sherrod DeGrippo, VP of Threat Research and Detection at Proofpoint. “Threat actors are hoping to evoke an emotional reaction and elicit a click without judgment,” she adds. Increased Volume and Quality The automation capabilities of AI significantly reduce the cost and effort required to launch phishing campaigns. This allows cyber criminals to scale up their operations, potentially increasing the number of attacks by more than 95% while maintaining or improving success rates. As a result, we can expect a surge in both the volume and quality of phishing attempts in the coming years. Advanced Deepfake Technology Deepfake technology has become more accessible and sophisticated, enabling attackers to create convincing audio and video impersonations. This advancement has led to a rise in voice phishing (vishing) attacks, where criminals can clone voices with just an hour of audio footage, making phone-based scams much more believable. AI-Powered Conversational Phishing Should a victim respond to an initial phishing attempt, AI-driven chatbots can now engage in natural, context-aware conversations. These bots analyze previous exchanges to deliver timely and believable responses, subtly guiding targets towards revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Rapid Adaptation AI enables phishing campaigns to evolve in real time based on victim behavior and response rates. This adaptive capability allows attackers to quickly refine their tactics, abandoning unsuccessful approaches and doubling down on effective strategies. As AI continues to enhance the sophistication of phishing attacks, organizations and individuals must remain vigilant and adapt their cybersecurity strategies accordingly. This includes implementing advanced AI-powered security solutions, regularly updating phishing awareness training, and adopting a zero-trust approach to digital communications. Phishing Prevention Preventing phishing attacks requires a combination of user training to recognize the warning signs and robust cybersecurity systems to stop payloads. Email filters are helpful with phishing, but human prevention is still critical. Proofpoint’s Sr. Product Marketing Manager Sara Pan warns, “Nine times out of 10, attackers and scammers will try to manipulate our emotions. And one of the most common emotional tools that we see in phishing attacks is fear.” This psychological manipulation is precisely why technical solutions alone cannot fully address the phishing threat landscape. A few ways your organization can prevent being a victim of phishing: Train users to detect a phishing email: a sense of urgency and requests for personal data, including passwords, embedded links, and attachments, are all warning signs. “Attackers will urge victims to take immediate action, so they don’t have time to think, increasing the success rate of their attack,” Pan says. Users must be able to identify these warning signs to defend against phishing. Avoid clicking links: instead of clicking a link and authenticating into a web page directly from an embedded link, type the official domain into a browser and authenticate directly from the manually typed site. Use anti-phishing email security: artificial intelligence scans incoming messages, detects suspicious messages, and quarantines them without allowing phishing messages to reach the recipient’s inbox. Proofpoint’s advanced email security solutions detect and block an average of 66 million business email compromise (BEC) attacks per month. Change passwords regularly: users should be forced to change their passwords every 30-45 days to reduce an attacker’s window of opportunity. Based on Proofpoint’s 2024 State of Phish report, reusing or sharing passwords ranks highest as the most risky behavior. Update software and firmware: software and firmware developers release updates to remediate bugs and security issues. Always install these updates to ensure known vulnerabilities are no longer in your infrastructure. This practice helps close potential entry points that phishing campaigns often exploit. Install firewalls: firewalls control inbound and outbound traffic. Malware installed from phishing silently eavesdrops and sends private data to an attacker, but a firewall blocks malicious outgoing requests and logs them for further review. Avoid clicking on popups: attackers change the location of the X button on a popup window to trick users into opening a malicious site or downloading malware. Popup blockers stop many popups, but false negatives are still possible. Teaching users to recognize these manipulation tactics is essential to building security awareness. Be cautious about disclosing credit card data: unless you know the site is entirely trustworthy, never give credit card data to a website you don’t recognize. Any site promising gifts or money should be used with caution. This vigilance should extend to QR codes and other emerging phishing vectors that Sara Pan identifies as growing threats. Technology is pivotal in preventing phishing attacks, but awareness is equally vital. “Since people are the primary target of these evolving phishing attacks, you want to empower them with the right knowledge and tools to protect themselves and your organization,” Pan highlights. How AI Is Advancing Detection AI is revolutionizing phishing detection, making it more sophisticated and effective in combating increasingly advanced cyber threats. Here’s how AI is transforming the landscape of phishing defense: Machine learning for pattern recognition: AI-powered systems utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of email, web traffic, and user behavior data. This enables the detection of subtle patterns and anomalies that may indicate phishing attempts, even when traditional rule-based systems fail. Real-time threat analysis: Unlike traditional tools, AI can process and evaluate potential threats in real time, significantly reducing the window of opportunity for attackers. This rapid response capability is crucial in preventing successful phishing attacks before they can cause harm. Advanced email filtering: AI systems now analyze email headers, content, and metadata with unprecedented accuracy. By leveraging natural language processing and contextual analysis, these systems can identify sophisticated phishing attempts that might otherwise slip through conventional filters. Visual-AI for phishing detection: Innovative Visual-AI technologies are being integrated into phishing detection workflows. These systems visually analyze emails and web pages, mimicking human perception of high-risk elements that code-based detection might miss. This approach provides an additional layer of security, especially against visually deceptive phishing tactics. Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection: AI models can monitor and learn from user behavior patterns, enabling them to detect anomalies such as unusual login attempts or suspicious clicks. This behavioral analysis adds another dimension to phishing detection, making it harder for attackers to mimic legitimate user actions. Continuous learning and adaptation: Perhaps most importantly, AI-powered phishing detection systems continuously learn and adapt. As new phishing techniques emerge, these systems update their models, ensuring they remain effective against evolving threats. “Some of the scarier tools are being birthed out of the dark web. You break into an email server, and then the AI goes and reads all the conversations and tells you how to best scam this organization,” notes Bastien Treptel, Co-founder of CTRL Group. By leveraging these AI-driven approaches, organizations can significantly enhance their defenses against phishing attacks, providing a more robust and dynamic security posture in the face of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Phishing Protection Phishing protection is the security measures organizations can take to mitigate phishing attacks on their employees and systems. Security awareness training and education through real-world examples and exercises help users identify phishing. Organizations often work with experts who send simulated phishing emails to employees and track who opened the email and clicked the link. Some email gateway solutions can catch and classify phishing emails based on the known bad reputation of the embedded URLs. However, these solutions are not always reliable in detecting well-crafted phishing messages from compromised legitimate websites. The most effective systems identify suspicious emails based on unusual traffic patterns, rewrite the embedded URL, and monitor the URL for in-page exploits and downloads. Monitoring tools quarantine suspicious email messages so administrators can research ongoing phishing attacks. If a high number of phishing emails are detected, administrators can alert employees and reduce the chance of a successful targeted phishing campaign. Another critical line of defense is user-based awareness training on the latest phishing and social engineering techniques to reduce the risk of breaches and generate a culture of cybersecurity. Learn more about Email Protection What to Do If You’ve Fallen Victim Once an attacker has accessed your information to an attacker, they will likely disclose it to other scammers. You may receive vishing and smishing messages, new phishing emails, and voice calls. Always be alert for suspicious messages asking for your information or financial details. If you respond to a phishing email, “you’ll need to act quickly to mitigate the damage,” emphasizes Cybersecurity Analyst Dave Cook. In this post, he outlines steps to take if you’ve responded to a phishing email (condensed below): Change passwords: Immediately update passwords and ensure they are complex and unique. Report incident: Promptly inform the IT department or email provider about the phishing email. Enable MFA: Implement multifactor authentication for an extra layer of security. Monitor accounts: Scan devices for malware and check for any suspicious activity. Contact affected organization: Alert the company impersonated in the phishing attempt. Educate yourself: Learn about phishing tactics and how to identify suspicious emails. At the company-wide level, Cook suggests that organizations “establish clear guidelines so that users know exactly what to do if they fall prey to a phishing scam. These guidelines should include changing passwords, notifying IT, enabling 2FA, checking for malware, and remaining vigilant in the future.” The Federal Trade Commission has a website dedicated to identity theft to help you mitigate damages and monitor your credit score. To detect and remove the malware, ensure your antivirus software is up-to-date and has the latest patches installed. Stay Vigilant with the Right Human-Centric Security Provider Phishing remains a highly dynamic and evolving cybersecurity threat in 2025, demanding constant vigilance and adaptation from organizations and individuals alike. As attackers leverage advanced technologies like AI and machine learning, phishing attempts have become increasingly sophisticated, personalized, and difficult to detect. The surge in AI-powered attacks, coupled with the expansion of attack vectors beyond traditional email to include social media, messaging apps, and even voice communications, has made phishing a pervasive threat across all digital platforms. The landscape is constantly shifting, with billions of phishing emails daily and new techniques like polymorphic attacks and white noise phishing. As social engineering tactics become more refined and targeted, the human element remains a critical vulnerability. Phishing continues to be a significant contributor to data breaches and financial losses, so organizations must adopt a multi-faceted approach that combines advanced technical defenses, continuous employee education, and real-time threat intelligence to stay ahead of this ever-evolving threat.

Phishing FAQs How to Report Phishing Emails If you think you’re the target of a phishing campaign, the first step is to report it to the appropriate people. On a corporate network, it’s best to report it to IT staff to review the message and determine if it’s a targeted campaign. For individuals, you can report fraud and phishing to the FTC. What Is Trap Phishing? Phishing has many forms, but one effective way to trick people into falling for fraud is to pretend to be a sender from a legitimate organization. A phishing trap lures users to a malicious website using familiar business references and the same logo, designs, and interface as a bank, ecommerce, or other recognizable popular brands. This is also known as a Watering Hole attack. What Is Barrel Phishing? To avoid filters, an attacker might send an initial benign-looking email to establish trust first, and then send a second email with a link or request for sensitive information. Barrel phishing takes more effort from the attacker, but the effect can be more damaging as targeted users feel they can trust the email sender. How to Spot a Phishing Email The main goal of phishing is to steal credentials (credential phishing), sensitive information, or trick individuals into sending money. In order to spot a phishing email, always be wary of messages that ask for sensitive information or provide a link where you immediately need to authenticate. What Is the Most Common Type of Phishing? Email phishing remains the most common type, with 3.4 billion malicious emails sent daily in 2025. Attackers frequently impersonate brands like Microsoft and Google, using deceptive links to trick recipients into sharing credentials or downloading malware. These emails mimic trusted sources like Amazon or banks, often compelling you to act urgently. Always verify sender addresses and avoid clicking suspicious links, even if the message appears legitimate. What Are Examples of Phishing? Phishing examples include deceptive emails claiming to be from banks requesting account verification, fake shipping notifications with malicious links, social media messages with suspicious attachments, and text messages impersonating government agencies. Other common tactics include phony login pages for popular services like Microsoft 365 or Google, fraudulent password reset requests, and urgent messages claiming your account has been compromised. Always verify the sender and avoid clicking suspicious links.

Recognize and Report Phishing Avoid phishing with these simple tips. Don’t Take the Bait Phishing occurs when criminals try to get us to open harmful links, emails or attachments that could request our personal information or infect our devices. Phishing messages or “bait” usually come in the form of an email, text, direct message on social media or phone call. These messages are often designed to look like they come from a trusted person or organization, to get us to respond. Recognize and Report Phishing How to Avoid Phishing! (We Can Secure Our World) Recognize and Report Phishing | Audio DescriptionHow to Avoid Phishing! (We Can Secure Our World) | Audio DescriptionStay Safe with Three Simple Tips1. RecognizeLook for these common signs:Urgent or emotionally appealing language, especially messages that claim dire consequences for not responding immediatelyRequests to send personal and financial informationUntrusted shortened URLsIncorrect email addresses or links, like amazan.comA common sign used to be poor grammar or misspellings although in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) some emails will now have perfect grammar and spelling, so look out for the other signs.2. ResistIf you suspect phishing, resist the temptation to click on links or attachments that seem too good to be true and may be trying to access your personal information. Instead, report the phish to protect yourself and others. Typically, you’ll find options to report near the person’s email address or username. You can also report via the “report spam” button in the toolbar or settings.3. DeleteDelete the message. Don’t reply or click on any attachment or link, including any “unsubscribe” link. Just delete. Phishing Tip Sheet Download the Secure Our World Phishing Tip Sheet to share with friends and family. Download Tip Sheet If a message looks suspicious, it's probably phishing. However, if you think it could be real, don't click on any link or call any number in the message. Look up another way to contact the company or person directly:Go to the company's website and capture their contact information from the verified website. Search for the site in your web browser or type the address yourself if you’re sure you know it.Use another way to reach the person to confirm whether they contacted you. For example, if you get a strange message from your friend on Facebook, and you have their phone number, text or call them to ask if they sent the message. Omar Got Phished and Now Knows How to Avoid Phishing Omar is a busy professional who works long hours, regularly goes to the gym, and makes time for friends and family. Like many of us, he usually shops online. One day, Omar received an email that looked like it came from an online order. The email said his payment didn’t go through, and he needed to log into his account to approve the payment method. The email inserted a shortcut link to a website that looked like the vendor’s and insisted he sign into his account immediately. Because Omar was in a hurry, he didn’t realize that the email and website weren’t quite right. Omar should have noticed the email address was not from his vendor’s dot com domain and that the urgent messaging in the email was sent from a hacker using a login credential phishing attempt, where the hacker tricked Omar into revealing his login credentials. Once Omar had logged into the fake site and approved the “purchase,” hackers were able to steal his password and credit card information. They made various purchases using Omar’s money. Luckily, Omar was able to eventually recover most of his financial losses, although it took many hours on the phone with his bank and the retailer to figure it out. Now, Omar pauses and thinks twice when he receives urgent messages requesting information. He knows what warning signs to look out for, like messaging requiring immediate response, and always types the retailer’s website directly into the URL instead of clicking a link in an email. Omar enjoys shopping online with less stress since he knows how to secure his world. Other Ways We Can Protect Ourselves Online Online criminals look for easy targets, like people who don’t take basic precautions. If we take the following steps, we won’t be as vulnerable to their deceptive tactics. It will be much harder to scam us or steal our information. Let’s start now. Secure Yourself & Your Family We can all protect ourselves, our friends and our families from online threats. It’s fast. It’s easy. Use Strong Passwords Using strong passwords and a password manager are some easy ways to protect ourselves from someone logging into an account and stealing data or money. Turn on MFA Multifactor authentication means using more than a password to access an app or account. With MFA, we might be asked to enter a text code or use a fingerprint. It alerts us and prevents others from accessing our accounts. Update Software Don't delay software updates. Flaws in software can give criminals access to files or accounts. Programmers fix these flaws as soon as they can, but we must install updates for the latest protection!

Labs If you're familiar with the basic concepts behind SQLi vulnerabilities and want to practice exploiting them on some realistic, deliberately vulnerable targets, you can access labs in this topic from the link below. View all SQL injection labsWhat is SQL injection (SQLi)? SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior. In some situations, an attacker can escalate a SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure. It can also enable them to perform denial-of-service attacks. What is the impact of a successful SQL injection attack? A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as: Passwords. Credit card details. Personal user information. SQL injection attacks have been used in many high-profile data breaches over the years. These have caused reputational damage and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period. How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. To do this, you would typically submit: The single quote character ' and look for errors or other anomalies. Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses. Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and look for differences in the application's responses. Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond. OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions. Alternatively, you can find the majority of SQL injection vulnerabilities quickly and reliably using Burp Scanner. SQL injection in different parts of the query Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the WHERE clause of a SELECT query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection. However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are: In UPDATE statements, within the updated values or the WHERE clause. In INSERT statements, within the inserted values. In SELECT statements, within the table or column name. In SELECT statements, within the ORDER BY clause. SQL injection examples There are lots of SQL injection vulnerabilities, attacks, and techniques, that occur in different situations. Some common SQL injection examples include: Retrieving hidden data, where you can modify a SQL query to return additional results. Subverting application logic, where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic. UNION attacks, where you can retrieve data from different database tables. Blind SQL injection, where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses. Retrieving hidden data Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL: https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts This causes the application to make a SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 This SQL query asks the database to return: all details (*) from the products table where the category is Gifts and released is 1. The restriction released = 1 is being used to hide products that are not released. We could assume for unreleased products, released = 0. The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks. This means an attacker can construct the following attack, for example: https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'-- This results in the SQL query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1 Crucially, note that -- is a comment indicator in SQL. This means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment, effectively removing it. In this example, this means the query no longer includes AND released = 1. As a result, all products are displayed, including those that are not yet released. You can use a similar attack to cause the application to display all the products in any category, including categories that they don't know about: https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1-- This results in the SQL query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1 The modified query returns all items where either the category is Gifts, or 1 is equal to 1. As 1=1 is always true, the query returns all items. Warning Take care when injecting the condition OR 1=1 into a SQL query. Even if it appears to be harmless in the context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an UPDATE or DELETE statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data. Subverting application logic Imagine an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username wiener and the password bluecheese, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese' If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected. In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence -- to remove the password check from the WHERE clause of the query. For example, submitting the username administrator'-- and a blank password results in the following query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = '' This query returns the user whose username is administrator and successfully logs the attacker in as that user. Retrieving data from other database tables In cases where the application responds with the results of a SQL query, an attacker can use a SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve data from other tables within the database. You can use the UNION keyword to execute an additional SELECT query and append the results to the original query. For example, if an application executes the following query containing the user input Gifts: SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' An attacker can submit the input: ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- This causes the application to return all usernames and passwords along with the names and descriptions of products. Read more SQL injection UNION attacksBlind SQL injection vulnerabilities Many instances of SQL injection are blind vulnerabilities. This means that the application does not return the results of the SQL query or the details of any database errors within its responses. Blind vulnerabilities can still be exploited to access unauthorized data, but the techniques involved are generally more complicated and difficult to perform. The following techniques can be used to exploit blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the database involved: You can change the logic of the query to trigger a detectable difference in the application's response depending on the truth of a single condition. This might involve injecting a new condition into some Boolean logic, or conditionally triggering an error such as a divide-by-zero. You can conditionally trigger a time delay in the processing of the query. This enables you to infer the truth of the condition based on the time that the application takes to respond. You can trigger an out-of-band network interaction, using OAST techniques. This technique is extremely powerful and works in situations where the other techniques do not. Often, you can directly exfiltrate data via the out-of-band channel. For example, you can place the data into a DNS lookup for a domain that you control. Read more Blind SQL injection Second-order SQL injection First-order SQL injection occurs when the application processes user input from an HTTP request and incorporates the input into a SQL query in an unsafe way. Second-order SQL injection occurs when the application takes user input from an HTTP request and stores it for future use. This is usually done by placing the input into a database, but no vulnerability occurs at the point where the data is stored. Later, when handling a different HTTP request, the application retrieves the stored data and incorporates it into a SQL query in an unsafe way. For this reason, second-order SQL injection is also known as stored SQL injection. Second-order SQL injection often occurs in situations where developers are aware of SQL injection vulnerabilities, and so safely handle the initial placement of the input into the database. When the data is later processed, it is deemed to be safe, since it was previously placed into the database safely. At this point, the data is handled in an unsafe way, because the developer wrongly deems it to be trusted. Examining the database Some core features of the SQL language are implemented in the same way across popular database platforms, and so many ways of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities work identically on different types of database. However, there are also many differences between common databases. These mean that some techniques for detecting and exploiting SQL injection work differently on different platforms. For example: Syntax for string concatenation. Comments. Batched (or stacked) queries. Platform-specific APIs. Error messages. Read more SQL injection cheat sheet After you identify a SQL injection vulnerability, it's often useful to obtain information about the database. This information can help you to exploit the vulnerability. You can query the version details for the database. Different methods work for different database types. This means that if you find a particular method that works, you can infer the database type. For example, on Oracle you can execute: SELECT * FROM v$version You can also identify what database tables exist, and the columns they contain. For example, on most databases you can execute the following query to list the tables: SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables Read more Examining the database in SQL injection attacksSQL injection cheat sheetSQL injection in different contexts In the previous labs, you used the query string to inject your malicious SQL payload. However, you can perform SQL injection attacks using any controllable input that is processed as a SQL query by the application. For example, some websites take input in JSON or XML format and use this to query the database. These different formats may provide different ways for you to obfuscate attacks that are otherwise blocked due to WAFs and other defense mechanisms. Weak implementations often look for common SQL injection keywords within the request, so you may be able to bypass these filters by encoding or escaping characters in the prohibited keywords. For example, the following XML-based SQL injection uses an XML escape sequence to encode the S character in SELECT: <stockCheck> <productId>123</productId> <storeId>999 &#x53;ELECT * FROM information_schema.tables</storeId> </stockCheck> This will be decoded server-side before being passed to the SQL interpreter. How to prevent SQL injection You can prevent most instances of SQL injection using parameterized queries instead of string concatenation within the query. These parameterized queries are also know as \"prepared statements\". The following code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is concatenated directly into the query: String query = \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '\"+ input + \"'\"; Statement statement = connection.createStatement(); ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query); You can rewrite this code in a way that prevents the user input from interfering with the query structure: PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(\"SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?\"); statement.setString(1, input); ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(); You can use parameterized queries for any situation where untrusted input appears as data within the query, including the WHERE clause and values in an INSERT or UPDATE statement. They can't be used to handle untrusted input in other parts of the query, such as table or column names, or the ORDER BY clause. Application functionality that places untrusted data into these parts of the query needs to take a different approach, such as: Whitelisting permitted input values. Using different logic to deliver the required behavior. For a parameterized query to be effective in preventing SQL injection, the string that is used in the query must always be a hard-coded constant. It must never contain any variable data from any origin. Do not be tempted to decide case-by-case whether an item of data is trusted, and continue using string concatenation within the query for cases that are considered safe. It's easy to make mistakes about the possible origin of data, or for changes in other code to taint trusted data.

A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands. Threat Modeling SQL injection attacks allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, or become administrators of the database server. SQL Injection is very common with PHP and ASP applications due to the prevalence of older functional interfaces. Due to the nature of programmatic interfaces available, J2EE and ASP.NET applications are less likely to have easily exploited SQL injections. The severity of SQL Injection attacks is limited by the attacker’s skill and imagination, and to a lesser extent, defense in depth countermeasures, such as low privilege connections to the database server and so on. In general, consider SQL Injection a high impact severity. Related Security Activities How to Avoid SQL Injection Vulnerabilities See the OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet.

How to Test for SQL Injection Vulnerabilities See the OWASP Testing Guide for information on testing for SQL Injection vulnerabilities. How to Bypass Web Application Firewalls with SQLi See the OWASP Article on using SQL Injection to bypass a WAF Description SQL injection attack occurs when: An unintended data enters a program from an untrusted source. The data is used to dynamically construct a SQL query The main consequences are: Confidentiality: Since SQL databases generally hold sensitive data, loss of confidentiality is a frequent problem with SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Authentication: If poor SQL commands are used to check user names and passwords, it may be possible to connect to a system as another user with no previous knowledge of the password. Authorization: If authorization information is held in a SQL database, it may be possible to change this information through the successful exploitation of a SQL Injection vulnerability. Integrity: Just as it may be possible to read sensitive information, it is also possible to make changes or even delete this information with a SQL Injection attack. Risk Factors The platform affected can be: Language: SQL Platform: Any (requires interaction with a SQL database) SQL Injection has become a common issue with database-driven web sites. The flaw is easily detected, and easily exploited, and as such, any site or software package with even a minimal user base is likely to be subject to an attempted attack of this kind. Essentially, the attack is accomplished by placing a meta character into data input to then place SQL commands in the control plane, which did not exist there before. This flaw depends on the fact that SQL makes no real distinction between the control and data planes. Examples Example 1 In SQL: select id, firstname, lastname from authors If one provided: Firstname: evil'ex and Lastname: Newman the query string becomes: select id, firstname, lastname from authors where firstname = 'evil'ex' and lastname ='newman' which the database attempts to run as: Incorrect syntax near il' as the database tried to execute evil. A safe version of the above SQL statement could be coded in Java as: String firstname = req.getParameter(\"firstname\"); String lastname = req.getParameter(\"lastname\"); // FIXME: do your own validation to detect attacks String query = \"SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM authors WHERE firstname = ? and lastname = ?\"; PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement( query ); pstmt.setString( 1, firstname ); pstmt.setString( 2, lastname ); try { ResultSet results = pstmt.execute( ); } Example 2 The following C# code dynamically constructs and executes a SQL query that searches for items matching a specified name. The query restricts the items displayed to those where owner matches the user name of the currently-authenticated user. ... string userName = ctx.getAuthenticatedUserName(); string query = \"SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = '\" + userName + \"' AND itemname = '\" + ItemName.Text + \"'\"; sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, conn); DataTable dt = new DataTable(); sda.Fill(dt); ... The query that this code intends to execute follows: SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = AND itemname = ; However, because the query is constructed dynamically by concatenating a constant base query string and a user input string, the query only behaves correctly if itemName does not contain a single-quote character. If an attacker with the user name wiley enters the string \"name' OR 'a'='a\" for itemName, then the query becomes the following: SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = 'wiley' AND itemname = 'name' OR 'a'='a'; The addition of the OR 'a'='a' condition causes the where clause to always evaluate to true, so the query becomes logically equivalent to the much simpler query: SELECT * FROM items; This simplification of the query allows the attacker to bypass the requirement that the query only return items owned by the authenticated user; the query now returns all entries stored in the items table, regardless of their specified owner. Example 3 This example examines the effects of a different malicious value passed to the query constructed and executed in Example 1. If an attacker with the user name hacker enters the string \"name'); DELETE FROM items; --\" for itemName, then the query becomes the following two queries: SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = 'hacker' AND itemname = 'name'; DELETE FROM items; --' Many database servers, including Microsoft® SQL Server 2000, allow multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons to be executed at once. While this attack string results in an error in Oracle and other database servers that do not allow the batch-execution of statements separated by semicolons, in databases that do allow batch execution, this type of attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands against the database. Notice the trailing pair of hyphens (--), which specifies to most database servers that the remainder of the statement is to be treated as a comment and not executed. In this case the comment character serves to remove the trailing single-quote left over from the modified query. In a database where comments are not allowed to be used in this way, the general attack could still be made effective using a trick similar to the one shown in Example 1. If an attacker enters the string \"name'); DELETE FROM items; SELECT \\* FROM items WHERE 'a'='a\", the following three valid statements will be created: SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = 'hacker' AND itemname = 'name'; DELETE FROM items; SELECT * FROM items WHERE 'a'='a'; One traditional approach to preventing SQL injection attacks is to handle them as an input validation problem and either accept only characters from an allow list of safe values or identify and escape a deny list of potentially malicious values. An allow list can be a very effective means of enforcing strict input validation rules, but parameterized SQL statements require less maintenance and can offer more guarantees with respect to security. As is almost always the case, deny listing is riddled with loopholes that make it ineffective at preventing SQL injection attacks. For example, attackers can: Target fields that are not quoted Find ways to bypass the need for certain escaped meta-characters Use stored procedures to hide the injected meta-characters Manually escaping characters in input to SQL queries can help, but it will not make your application secure from SQL injection attacks. Another solution commonly proposed for dealing with SQL injection attacks is to use stored procedures. Although stored procedures prevent some types of SQL injection attacks, they fail to protect against many others. For example, the following PL/SQL procedure is vulnerable to the same SQL injection attack shown in the first example. procedure get_item ( itm_cv IN OUT ItmCurTyp, usr in varchar2, itm in varchar2) is open itm_cv for ' SELECT * FROM items WHERE ' || 'owner = '''|| usr || ' AND itemname = ''' || itm || ''''; end get_item; Stored procedures typically help prevent SQL injection attacks by limiting the types of statements that can be passed to their parameters. However, there are many ways around the limitations and many interesting statements that can still be passed to stored procedures. Again, stored procedures can prevent some exploits, but they will not make your application secure against SQL injection attacks.

These statements control a database server behind a web application. Attackers can use SQL Injection vulnerabilities to bypass application security measures. They can go around authentication and authorization of a web page or web application and retrieve the content of the entire SQL database. They can also use SQL Injection to add, modify, and delete records in the database. An SQL Injection vulnerability may affect any website or web application that uses an SQL database such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, or others. Criminals may use it to gain unauthorized access to your sensitive data: customer information, personal data, trade secrets, intellectual property, and more. SQL Injection attacks are one of the oldest, most prevalent, and most dangerous web application vulnerabilities. The OWASP organization (Open Web Application Security Project) lists injections in their OWASP Top 10 2017 document as the number one threat to web application security. What are SQL Queries? SQL is a query language that was designed to manage data stored in relational databases. You can use it to access, modify, and delete data. SQL queries are usually commands that request a specific set of results from the database using the SELECT statement, though other statements also exist to perform database operations, like UPDATE, DELETE, or DROP. Applications incorporate user inputs into SQL queries to fetch the required data from their backend database. At its simplest, a SELECT statement to check user login credentials against the users table could be: SELECT id FROM users WHERE username='user-input-here' AND password='user-input-here' This will return a user ID if the specified username and password combination exists and NULL (an empty result) otherwise. If the application code directly inserts raw user inputs into the query, it is most likely vulnerable to SQL injection. How and Why Is an SQL Injection Attack Performed To make an SQL Injection attack, an attacker must first find vulnerable user inputs within the web page or web application. A web page or web application that has an SQL Injection vulnerability uses such user input directly in an SQL query. The attacker can create input content. Such content is often called a malicious payload and is the key part of the attack. After the attacker sends this content, malicious SQL commands are executed in the database. What is the Impact of a Successful SQL Injection Attack? Many web applications and websites store all the data in SQL databases. In some cases, you can also use SQL commands to run operating system commands. Therefore, a successful SQL Injection attack can have very serious consequences. Attackers can use SQL Injections to find the credentials of other users in the database. They can then impersonate these users. The impersonated user may be a database administrator with all database privileges. SQL lets you select and output data from the database. An SQL Injection vulnerability could allow the attacker to gain complete access to all data in a database server. SQL also lets you alter data in a database and add new data. For example, in a financial application, an attacker could use SQL Injection to alter balances, void transactions, or transfer money to their account. You can use SQL to delete records from a database, even drop tables. Even if the administrator makes database backups, deletion of data could affect application availability until the database is restored. Also, backups may not cover the most recent data. In some database servers, you can access the operating system using the database server. This may be intentional or accidental. In such case, an attacker could use an SQL Injection as the initial vector and then attack the internal network behind a firewall. Types of SQL Injections There are several types of SQL Injection attacks: in-band SQLi (using database errors or UNION commands), blind SQLi, and out-of-band SQLi. You can read more about them in the following articles: Types of SQL Injection (SQLi), Blind SQL Injection: What is it. In-band SQLi “Regular” SQL injection is also called in-band SQLi because the attacker is able to receive results in the same way they performed the attack itself. A typical example would be to submit a web form with an SQLi payload and then see the returned database records on the same page. Out-of-band SQLi When an SQLi attack and its results use different channels, you have out-of-band (OOB) SQL injection. OOB attacks are used when the attacker can send a request but cannot see the response. Common OOB techniques include sending attack results to an attacker-controlled server and hiding them in DNS queries. Inferential (Blind) SQLi Blind SQL injection is an advanced technique for indirectly reconstructing small chunks of data. The main two types of inferential SQLi are timing-based and Boolean. Timing-based attacks rely on the database taking longer to respond to some queries than others, while Boolean attacks use a large number of yes/no questions to eventually home in on a specific value. Second-order SQLi Similar to stored XSS, second-order SQL injection payloads can also be stored in an external system and only executed when loaded by a user. While not as common as direct SQL injections, a single second-order attack could potentially affect a large number of users. SQL Injection Examples The first SQL Injection example is very simple. It shows, how an attacker can use an SQL Injection vulnerability to go around application security and authenticate as the administrator. The following script is pseudocode executed on a web server. It is a simple example of authenticating with a username and a password. The example database has a table named users with the following columns: username and password. # Define POST variables uname = request.POST['username'] passwd = request.POST['password'] # SQL query vulnerable to SQLi sql = “SELECT id FROM users WHERE username=’” + uname + “’ AND password=’” + passwd + “’” # Execute the SQL statement database.execute(sql) These input fields are vulnerable to SQL Injection. An attacker could use SQL commands in the input in a way that would alter the SQL statement executed by the database server. For example, they could use a trick involving a single quote and set the passwd field to: password' OR 1=1 As a result, the database server runs the following SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE username='username' AND password='password' OR 1=1' Because of the OR 1=1 statement, the WHERE clause returns the first id from the users table no matter what the username and password are. The first user id in a database is very often the administrator. In this way, the attacker not only bypasses authentication but also gains administrator privileges. They can also comment out the rest of the SQL statement to control the execution of the SQL query further: -- MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite ' OR '1'='1' -- ' OR '1'='1' /* -- MySQL ' OR '1'='1' # -- Access (using null characters) ' OR '1'='1' %00 ' OR '1'='1' %16 Example of a Union-Based SQL Injection One of the most common types of SQL Injection uses the UNION operator. It allows the attacker to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result. The technique is called union-based SQL Injection. The following is an example of this technique. It uses the web page testphp.vulnweb.com, an intentionally vulnerable website hosted by Acunetix. The following HTTP request is a normal request that a legitimate user would send: GET http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 HTTP/1.1 Host: testphp.vulnweb.com The artist parameter is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The following payload modifies the query to look for an inexistent record. It sets the value in the URL query string to -1. Of course, it could be any other value that does not exist in the database. However, a negative value is a good guess because an identifier in a database is rarely a negative number. In SQL Injection, the UNION operator is commonly used to attach a malicious SQL query to the original query intended to be run by the web application. The result of the injected query will be joined with the result of the original query. This allows the attacker to obtain column values from other tables. GET http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3 HTTP/1.1 Host: testphp.vulnweb.com The following example shows how an SQL Injection payload could be used to obtain more meaningful data from this intentionally vulnerable site: GET http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=-1 UNION SELECT 1,pass,cc FROM users WHERE uname='test' HTTP/1.1 Host: testphp.vulnweb.com To follow step-by-step how an SQL Injection attack is performed and what serious consequences it may have, see: Exploiting SQL Injection: a Hands-on Example. SQLi Prevention and Mitigation The only sure way to prevent SQL Injection attacks is input validation and parametrized queries including prepared statements. The application code should never use the input directly. The developer must sanitize all input, not only web form inputs such as login forms. They must remove potential malicious code elements such as single quotes. It is also a good idea to turn off the visibility of database errors on your production sites. Database errors can be used with SQL Injection to gain information about your database. If you discover an SQL Injection vulnerability, for example using an Acunetix scan, you may be unable to fix it immediately. For example, the vulnerability may be in open source code. In such cases, you can use a web application firewall to sanitize your input temporarily. To learn how to prevent SQL Injection attacks in the PHP language, see: Preventing SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in PHP Applications and Fixing Them. To find out how to do it in many other different programming languages, refer to the Bobby Tables guide to preventing SQL Injection. How to Prevent SQL Injections Preventing SQL Injection vulnerabilities is not easy. Specific prevention techniques depend on the subtype of SQLi vulnerability, on the SQL database engine, and on the programming language. However, there are certain general strategic principles that you should follow to keep your web application safe. Step 1: Train and maintain awareness To keep your web application safe, everyone involved in building the web application must be aware of the risks associated with SQL Injections. You should provide suitable security training to all your developers, QA staff, DevOps, and SysAdmins. You can start by referring them to this page. Step 2: Don’t trust any user input Treat all user input as untrusted. Any user input that is used in an SQL query introduces a risk of an SQL Injection. Treat input from authenticated and/or internal users the same way that you treat public input. Step 3: Use whitelists, not blacklists Don’t filter user input based on blacklists. A clever attacker will almost always find a way to circumvent your blacklist. If possible, verify and filter user input using strict whitelists only. Step 4: Adopt the latest technologies Older web development technologies don’t have SQLi protection. Use the latest version of the development environment and language and the latest technologies associated with that environment/language. For example, in PHP use PDO instead of MySQLi. Step 5: Employ verified mechanisms Don’t try to build SQLi protection from scratch. Most modern development technologies can offer you mechanisms to protect against SQLi. Use such mechanisms instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. For example, use parameterized queries or stored procedures. Step 6: Scan regularly (with Acunetix) SQL Injections may be introduced by your developers or through external libraries/modules/software. You should regularly scan your web applications using a web vulnerability scanner such as Acunetix. If you use Jenkins, you should install the Acunetix plugin to automatically scan every build. Further reading Types of SQL Injection A guide to preventing SQL Injection SQL Injection Cheat Sheet Frequently asked questions about SQL injection What is SQL Injection? SQL Injection is a web vulnerability caused by insecure coding. It allows an attacker to send commands to the database that the website or web application communicates with. This, in turn, lets the attacker get data from the database or even modify it. See a step-by-step example of how SQL Injections happen. How common are SQL Injections? SQL Injection is a very old vulnerability – it was discovered in 1998. However, according to our 2020 research, 8 percent of websites and web applications have SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Read our full report on the current state of web security. How dangerous are SQL Injections? A successful SQL Injection attack may lead to a complete compromise of a system or theft of the entire database. For example, an SQL Injection attack in 2019 led to the theft of complete tax data of 5 million people. Read more about the most massive SQL Injection attack in 2019. How to detect SQL Injections? The only efficient way to detect SQL Injections is by using a vulnerability scanner, often called a DAST tool (dynamic application security testing). Acunetix is known to be top-of-the-line in detecting SQL Injections and other vulnerabilities. Acunetix is able to reach where other scanners fail. Find out what Acunetix can do for you. How to prevent SQL Injections? The best way to prevent SQL Injections is to use safe programming functions that make SQL Injections impossible: parameterized queries (prepared statements) and stored procedures. Every major programming language currently has such safe functions and every developer should only use such safe functions to work with the database. Browse a library of safe functions for all programming languages.

Malware definition Malware, or “malicious software,” is an umbrella term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems. Hostile, intrusive, and intentionally nasty, malware seeks to invade, damage, or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often by taking partial control over a device’s operations. Like the human flu, it interferes with normal functioning. The motives behind malware vary. Malware can be about making money off you, sabotaging your ability to get work done, making a political statement, or just bragging rights. Although malware cannot damage the physical hardware of systems or network equipment (with one known exception—see the Google Android section below), it can steal, encrypt, or delete your data, alter or hijack core computer functions, and spy on your computer activity without your knowledge or permission. You know how every year the medical community campaigns for everyone to get a flu shot? That’s because flu outbreaks typically have a season—a time of year when they start spreading and infecting people. In contrast, there are no predictable seasonal infections for PCs, smartphones, tablets, and enterprise networks. For them, it’s always flu season. But instead of suffering chills and body aches, users can fall ill from a kind of machine malady—malware. How can I tell if I have a malware infection? Malware can reveal itself with many different aberrant behaviors. Here are a few telltale signs that you have malware on your system: Your computer slows down. One of malware’s side effects is to reduce the speed of your operating system (OS), whether you’re navigating the Internet or just using your local applications, usage of your system’s resources appears abnormally high. You might even notice your computer’s fan whirring away at full speed—a good indicator that something is taking up system resources in the background. This tends to happen when your computer has been roped into a botnet; i.e. a network of enslaved computers used to perform DDoS attacks, blast out spam, or mine cryptocurrency. Your screen is inundated with annoying ads. Unexpected pop-up ads are a typical sign of a malware infection. They’re especially associated with a form of malware known as adware. What’s more, pop-ups usually come packaged with other hidden malware threats. So if you see something akin to “CONGRATULATIONS, You’ve won a free psychic reading!” in a pop-up, don’t click on it. Whatever free prize the ad promises, it will cost you plenty. Your system crashes. This can come as a freeze or a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), the latter occurs on Windows systems after encountering a fatal error. You notice a mysterious loss of disk space. This could be due to a bloated malware squatter, hiding in your hard drive aka bundleware. There’s a weird increase in your system’s Internet activity. Take Trojans for example. Once a Trojan lands on a target computer, the next thing it does is reach out to the attacker’s command and control server (C&C) to download a secondary infection, often ransomware. This could explain the spike in Internet activity. The same goes for botnets, spyware, and any other threat that requires back and forth communication with the C&C servers. Your browser settings change. If you notice your homepage changed or you have new toolbars, extensions, or plugins installed, then you might have some sort of malware infection. Causes vary, but this usually means you clicked on that “congratulations” pop-up, which downloaded some unwanted software. Your antivirus product stops working and you cannot turn it back on, leaving you unprotected against the sneaky malware that disabled it. You lose access to your files or your entire computer. This is symptomatic of a ransomware infection. The hackers announce themselves by leaving a ransom note on your desktop or changing your desktop wallpaper itself in to a ransom note (see GandCrab). In the note, the perpetrators typically inform you that your data has been encrypted and demand a ransom payment in exchange for decrypting your files. Even if everything seems to be working just fine on your system, don’t get complacent, because no news isn’t necessarily good news. Powerful malware can hide deep in your computer, evading detection, and going about its dirty business without raising any red flags. While we’ve provided a quick malware spotter’s guide, it really takes the unfaltering eye of a good cybersecurity program to detect malware on your system (more on that later). How do I get malware? The two most common ways that malware accesses your system are the Internet and email. So basically, anytime you’re connected online, you’re vulnerable. Malware can penetrate your computer when (deep breath now) you surf through hacked websites, view a legitimate site serving malicious ads, download infected files, install programs or apps from unfamiliar provide, open a malicious email attachment (malspam), or pretty much everything else you download from the web on to a device that lacks a quality anti-malware security application. Malicious apps can hide in seemingly legitimate applications, especially when they are downloaded from websites or direct links (in an email, text, or chat message) instead of an official app store. Here it’s important to look at the warning messages when installing applications, especially if they seek permission to access your email or other personal information. Types of malware Here are the most common offenders in the rogues’ gallery of malware: Adware is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser. Typically, it uses an underhanded method to either disguise itself as legitimate, or piggyback on another program to trick you into installing it on your PC, tablet, or mobile device. Spyware is malware that secretly observes the computer user’s activities without permission and reports it to the software’s author. A virus is malware that attaches to another program and, when executed—usually inadvertently by the user—replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and infecting them with its own bits of code. Worms are a type of malware similar to viruses. Like viruses, worms are self-replicating. The big difference is that worms can spread across systems on their own, whereas viruses need some sort of action from a user in order to initiate the infection. A Trojan, or Trojan horse, is one of the most dangerous malware types. It usually represents itself as something useful in order to trick you. Once it’s on your system, the attackers behind the Trojan gain unauthorized access to the affected computer. From there, Trojans can be used to steal financial information or install other forms of malware, often ransomware. Ransomware is a form of malware that locks you out of your device and/or encrypts your files, then forces you to pay a ransom to regain access. Ransomware has been called the cybercriminal’s weapon of choice because it demands a quick, profitable payment in hard-to-trace cryptocurrency. The code behind ransomware is easy to obtain through online criminal marketplaces and defending against it is very difficult. While ransomware attacks on individual consumers are down at the moment, attacks on businesses are up 365 percent for 2019. As an example, the Ryuk ransomware specifically targets high-profile organizations that are more likely to pay out large ransoms. For more, check out the Malwarebytes Labs Ransomware Retrospective. Rootkit is a form of malware that provides the attacker with administrator privileges on the infected system, also known as “root” access. Typically, it is also designed to stay hidden from the user, other software on the system, and the operating system itself. A keylogger is malware that records all the user’s keystrokes on the keyboard, typically storing the gathered information and sending it to the attacker, who is seeking sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details. Malicious cryptomining, also sometimes called drive-by mining or cryptojacking, is an increasingly prevalent malware usually installed by a Trojan. It allows someone else to use your computer to mine cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Monero. So instead of letting you cash in on your own computer’s horsepower, the cryptominers send the collected coins into their own account and not yours. Essentially, a malicious cryptominer is stealing your resources to make money. Exploits are a type of malware that takes advantage of bugs and vulnerabilities in a system in order to give the attacker access to your system. While there, the attacker might steal your data or drop some form of malware. A zero-day exploit refers to a software vulnerability for which there is currently no available defense or fix. What is the history of malware? Given the variety of malware types and the massive number of variants released into the wild daily, a full history of malware would comprise a list too long to include here. That said, a look at malware trends in recent decades is more manageable. Here are the main trends in malware development. The 1980s and onward: The theoretical underpinning of “self-reproducing automata” (i.e., viruses) dates back to a lecture delivered in 1949 by 20th century Renaissance man John von Neumann. However, the history of modern viruses begins with a program called Elk Cloner, which started infecting Apple II systems in 1982. Disseminated by infected floppy disks, the virus itself was harmless, but it spread to all disks attached to a system, exploding so virulently that it can be considered the first large-scale computer virus outbreak in history. Note that this was prior to any Windows PC malware. Since then, viruses and worms have become widespread. The 1990s: Microsoft Windows began its long run as the most popular OS in the world (not to be overtaken till Google’s Android many years later). As the Windows OS and its built-in applications grew in popularity, so too did the number of viruses written for the platform. In particular, malware authors started to write infectious code in the macro language of Microsoft Word. These macro viruses infected documents and templates rather than executable applications, although strictly speaking, the Word document macros are a form of executable code. 2002 to 2007: Instant messaging (IM) worms spread across popular IM networks, including AOL AIM, MSN Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger. Most attacks started with a social engineering ploy. Attackers might send out an IM that reads something like “Who’s with you in this picture?” or “OMG, I think you won the lottery!” along with a link to a malicious download. Once your system was infected, the IM worm would further propagate itself by sending malicious download links to everyone on your contact list. 2005 to 2009: Adware attacks proliferated, presenting unwanted advertisements to computer screens, sometimes in the form of a pop-up or in a window that users could not close. These ads often exploited legitimate software as a means to spread, but around 2008, software publishers began suing adware companies for fraud. The result was millions of dollars in fines. This eventually drove adware companies to shut down. Today’s tech support scams owe much to the adware of yesteryear, employing many of the same tricks as the old adware attacks; e.g., full screen ads that can’t be closed or exited. 2007 to 2009: Malware scammers turned to social networks such as Myspace as a channel for delivering rogue advertisements, links to phishing pages, and malicious applications. After Myspace declined in popularity, Facebook and Twitter became the preferred platforms. 2013: A new form of malware called ransomware launched an attack under the name CryptoLocker, which continued from early September 2013 to late May 2014, targeting computers running Windows. CryptoLocker succeeded in forcing victims to pay about $3 million in total, BBC News reported. Moreover, the ransomware’s success gave rise to an unending series of copycats. 2013 to 2017: Delivered through Trojans, exploits, and malvertising, ransomware became the king of malware, culminating in huge outbreaks in 2017 that affected businesses of all kinds. 2017: Cryptocurrency—and how to mine for it—has captured widespread attention, leading to a new malware scam called cryptojacking, or the act of secretly using someone else’s device to surreptitiously mine for cryptocurrency with the victims’ resources. 2018 to 2019: Ransomware made its big comeback. This time, however, cybercriminals shifted their focus from individual consumers to business targets. Riding a wave of GandCrab and Ryuk ransomware infections, attacks on businesses went up 365 percent from 2018 to 2019. As of this writing, there’s no indication the ransomware attacks will slow down. Do Macs get malware? Conventional wisdom has sometimes held that Macs and iPads are immune to catching viruses (and don’t need an antivirus). For the most part, that’s true. At the very least, it hasn’t happened in a long time. “Mac systems are subject to the same vulnerabilities (and subsequent symptoms of infection) as Windows machines and cannot be considered bulletproof.” Other kinds of malware are a different story. Mac systems are subject to the same vulnerabilities (and subsequent symptoms of infection) as Windows machines and cannot be considered bulletproof. For instance, the Mac’s built-in protection against malware doesn’t block all the adware and spyware bundled with fraudulent application downloads. Trojans and keyloggers are also threats. The first detection of ransomware for Macs occurred in March 2016, when a Trojan-delivered attack affected more than 7,000 Mac users. In fact, Malwarebytes saw more Mac malware in 2017 than in any previous year. By the end of 2017, the number of new unique threats that our professionals counted on the Mac platform was more than 270 percent higher compared to the number noted in 2016. Read more about the state of. Mac antivirus and anti-malware. Do mobile devices get malware? Malware criminals love the mobile market. After all, smartphones are sophisticated, complex handheld computers. They also offer an entrance into a treasure trove of personal information, financial details, and all manner of valuable data for those seeking to make a dishonest dollar. Unfortunately, this has spawned an exponentially increasing number of malicious attempts to take advantage of smartphone vulnerabilities. From adware, Trojans, spyware, worms, and ransomware, malware can find its way onto your phone in a number of ways. Clicking on a dodgy link or downloading an unreliable app are some obvious culprits, but you can also get infected through emails, texts, and even your Bluetooth connection. Moreover, malware such as worms can spread from one infected phone to another without any interaction from the user. The fact is, it’s a huge market (read: target). The GSMA, a trade body that represents mobile carriers, puts the number of mobile device users somewhere over 5 billion, worldwide. A quarter of these users own more than one device. Fraudsters find the mobile market very attractive and take advantage of a gigantic economy of scale to leverage their efforts. Mobile users are often easier to target as well. Most do not protect their phones as diligently as they do their computers, failing to install security software or keep their operating systems up to date. It’s not entirely our fault. Apple, on average, supports their phones—meaning you can download the latest iOS—five years after the launch date. Android phones can be updated for about three years. Infected mobile devices are a particularly insidious danger compared to a PC. Ironically, the “personal computer” isn’t personal anymore. Phones, conversely, go with us everywhere. As a society we’ve become so attached to our phones that there’s now an actual word for the fear we experience when we don’t have our phones: Nomophobia. A hacked microphone and camera can record everything you see and say. A hacked GPS can broadcast your every move. Even worse, mobile malware can be used to evade the multi-factor authentication (MFA) many apps use to keep our data secure. “The more popular Android platform attracts more malware than the iPhone.” Keep in mind that cheap phones can come with malware pre-installed, which can be difficult to remove (Malwarebytes for Android is a big help here). Regarding the mobile malware ecosystem, the two most prevalent smartphone operating systems are Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS. Android leads the market with 76 percent of all smartphone sales, followed by iOS with 22 percent of all smartphones sold. No big surprise then that the more popular Android platform attracts more malware than the iPhone. Let’s look at them each separately. How can I tell if my Android device has malware? There are a few unmistakable signs your Android phone is infected. That said, you may be infected if you see any of the following. A sudden appearance of pop-ups with invasive advertisements. If they appear out of nowhere and send you to sketchy websites, you’ve probably installed something that hides adware within it. It suffices to say—don’t click on these ads. A puzzling increase in data usage. Malware chews up your data plan by displaying ads and sending out the purloined information from your phone. Bogus charges on your bill. This happens when malicious software makes calls and sends texts to premium numbers. Your battery runs down quickly. Malware is a resource burden, gulping down your battery’s juice faster than normal. Your contacts receive strange emails and texts from your phone. Mobile malware often spreads from one device to another by means of emails and texts containing malicious links. Your phone is hot. A phone generally means the processor is being taxed by a lot of resource intensive activity. Malware? Possibly. The Loapi Trojan can push the processor to the point of overheating the phone, which makes the battery bulge, leaving your phone for dead. Apps you didn’t download. Sometimes you download seemingly legitimate apps that have malware buried in the code. This malware, in turn, downloads other malicious apps. It helps to stick to trusted apps from known sources, but even the Google Play store itself has dozens of malicious apps sneak through every year. Wi-Fi and Internet connections turn themselves on. This is another way malware propagates, ignoring your preferences and opening up infection channels. How can I tell if my iPhone or iPad has malware? Good news, Apple fans. Malware is not a significant issue on the iPhone. That is not to say it doesn’t exist, but it’s extremely rare. In fact, suffering a malware infection on an iPhone mostly only happens under three extraordinary circumstances. “While outright malware infections are unlikely, using an iPhone doesn’t protect you at all against robocalls or text message scams.” 1. A targeted attack by a nation-state-level adversary. In this case, a government has either created or purchased, at a cost of millions of dollars, a piece of malware engineered to take advantage of some obscure security hole in iOS. Don’t be shocked, because all devices have some sort of vulnerability. To be sure, Apple has done a fine job of securing iOS, even preventing any apps (including security software) from scanning the phone or other apps on the device’s system. This approach, known as the walled garden, is why there are so few examples of iOS malware—creating it is simply too expensive, difficult, and time consuming for most cybercriminals. One particularly noteworthy instance happened in 2016 when an internationally recognized human rights defender, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), received SMS text messages on his iPhone promising “new secrets” about detainees tortured in UAE jails. The targeted recipient was invited to click on an included link. He didn’t, but instead sent the message to cybersecurity researchers, who identified it as containing an exploit that would have turned the activist’s phone into a digital spy. The zero-day vulnerabilities used in this attack have since been patched. 2. An attack on a jailbroken iPhone. Jailbreaking an iPhone removes the restrictions and limitations Apple imposes as part of its walled garden approach to software design, mainly to allow the installation of apps from outside Apple’s App Store. Apple carefully vets the app developers it carries, even though malware piggybacking on a legitimate app has happened. 3. An attack on an outdated iPhone. On August 29, 2019 Apple fans’ heads exploded—there was a series of iOS exploits being used to infect normal, non-jailbroken iPhones with malware. The attack started when victims landed on a hacked website. From there, there the malicious websites infected devices with malware using a serious of exploits to get root access. Once the infection takes root, attackers are able to see your stored passwords, texts, call history, photos, contacts, notes and recordings. They can even track your GPS location. To this day, it’s unclear which sites served up the infection, but the exploits have been patched and it’s very unlikely you’ll catch this infection. That being said, if you’re using an outdated phone (older than iOS 12.1.4) and you never reset your phone, you could be vulnerable. One more point about Android and iOS threats. There’s two more cyberthreats that affect both iOS and Android users: phishing attacks and scam calls. As it pertains to phishing, if you tap a link in a message from an unknown source or someone you know who’s being spoofed, it could send you to a site faked to look like a legitimate site that asks for your login and other personal information. Bottom line: Always proceed with caution. Regarding scam calls—they’re the bane of our modern existence—calls from numbers you don’t know, sometimes in your own area code, with threatening pre-recorded messages purporting to be from various government agencies. Whoever the caller claims to be, unless it’s from a political candidate, airline, charity, healthcare provider, school, or debt collector—it’s probably illegal. Who does malware target? The answer here is: Take your pick. There are billions of consumer-owned devices out there. They’re connected to banks, retail store accounts, and anything else worth stealing. It’s a broad attack surface for adware and spyware, keyloggers, and malvertising—as well as an attractive method for lazy criminals to create and distribute malware to as many targets as possible, with proportionately little effort. “If you use your smartphone or tablet in the workplace, hackers can turn their attack to your employer.” While not currently popular with cybercriminals, cryptominers seem to be equal opportunity about their targets, going after both individuals and businesses. Ransomware, on the other hand, targets businesses, hospitals, municipalities, and retail store systems in disproportionately greater numbers than consumers. Also, it’s not just consumers that mobile spyware criminals target. If you use your smartphone or tablet in the workplace, hackers can turn their attack to your employer through vulnerabilities in mobile devices. Moreover, your corporation’s incident response team may not detect breaches that originate through a mobile device’s use of corporate email. To repeat, not all of the apps available through Apple’s App Store and Google Play are desirable and the problem is even more acute with third-party app stores. While the app store operators try to prevent malicious apps from penetrating their site, some inevitably slip through. These apps can steal user information, attempt to extort money from users, try to access corporate networks to which the device is connected, and force users to view unwanted ads or engage in other types of unsanitary activity. How to remove malware Follow these three easy steps to remove malware from your device. 1. Download and install a good cybersecurity program. As it happens, Malwarebytes has programs for every platform we’ve discussed in this article: Windows, Mac, Android, and Chromebook. 2. Run a scan using your new program. Even if you don’t opt for Malwarebytes Premium, the free version of Malwarebytes is still great at removing malware. The free version, however, does not proactively stop threats from getting on your system in the first place. 3. Change all your passwords. Now that you know you’re not being snooped on by some form of malware, you need to reset your passwords—not only for your PC or mobile device, but also your email, your social media accounts, your favorite shopping sites, and your online banking and billing centers. This may sound paranoid, but with spyware, banking Trojans and the like, you just don’t know for sure what data was captured before you stopped the infection. As always, use some form of multi-factor authentication (at least two-factor) and don’t think you need to memorize all your passwords. Use a password manager instead. If your iPhone or iPad is infected with malware (as improbable as that may be). Things are a little trickier. Apple does not permit scans of either the device’s system or other files, though Malwarebytes for iOS, for example, will screen and block scam calls and texts. Your only option is to wipe your phone with a factory reset, then restore it from your backup in iCloud or iTunes. If you didn’t backup your phone, then you’re starting over from scratch. How to protect against malware In no particular order, here’s our tips on protecting against malware. 1. Pay attention to the domain and be wary if the site isn’t a top-level domain, i.e., com, mil, net, org, edu, or biz, to name a few. 2. Use strong passwords with multi-factor authentication. A password manager can be a big help here. 3. Avoid clicking on pop-up ads while browsing the Internet. 4. Avoid opening email attachments from unknown senders. 5. Do not click on strange, unverified links in emails, texts, and social media messages. 6. Don’t download software from untrustworthy websites or peer-to-peer file transfer networks. 7. Stick to official apps from Google Play and Apple’s App Store on Android, OSX, and iOS (and don’t jailbreak your phone). PC users should check the ratings and reviews before installing any software. 8. Make sure your operating system, browsers, and plugins are patched and up to date. 9. Delete any programs you don’t use anymore. 10. Back up your data regularly. If your files become damaged, encrypted, or otherwise inaccessible, you’ll be covered. 11. Download and install a cybersecurity program that actively scans and blocks threats from getting on your device. Malwarebytes, for example, offers proactive cybersecurity programs for Windows, Mac, Android, and Chromebook. Plus, our latest offering, Malwarebytes Browser Guard. It’s free and it’s the only browser extension that can stop tech support scams along with any other unsafe and unwanted content that comes at you through your browser. Related Articles What is spam?

Malware (malicious software) is an umbrella term used to describe a program or code created to harm a computer, network, or server. Cybercriminals develop malware to infiltrate a computer system discreetly to breach or destroy sensitive data and computer systems. There are many types of malware infections, which make up most of the online threat landscape. Hackers have different goals when performing a malware attack on a system or organization, and it often depends on who is on the receiving end and the type of attack. Some of the most common goals of a malware attack include: Make a profit off targetsSabotageSteal confidential dataMake a statementBragging rights Expert Tip Who Are the Targets of Malware Attacks? Nobody is safe from the potential of a malware attack. Different hackers using different techniques will be looking to target individuals or organizations of different sizes, industries, and locations. Types of MalwareIn the years since the Morris Worm debuted, adversaries have applied a great deal of creativity to the concept of malware, coming up with new types of attacks as enterprise technology has evolved. The most common types of malware today are: TypeDescriptionRansomwareIn a ransomware attack, an adversary encrypts a victim’s data and offers to provide a decryption key in exchange for a payment. Ransomware attacks are usually launched through malicious links delivered via phishing emails, but unpatched vulnerabilities and policy misconfigurations are used as well.Fileless MalwareFileless malware is a type of malicious activity that uses native, legitimate tools built into a system to execute a cyber attack. Unlike traditional malware, fileless malware does not require an attacker to install any code on a target’s system, making it hard to detect.SpywareSpyware is a type of unwanted, malicious software that infects a computer or other device and collects information about a user’s web activity without their knowledge or consent.AdwareAdware is a type of spyware that watches a user’s online activity in order to determine which ads to show them. While adware is not inherently malicious, it has an impact on the performance of a user’s device and degrades the user experience.TrojanA trojan is malware that appears to be legitimate software disguised as native operating system programs or harmless files like free downloads. Trojans are installed through social engineering techniques such as phishing or bait websites. The zeus trojan malware, a variant, has the goal accessing financial information and adding machines to a botnet.WormsA worm is a self-contained program that replicates itself and spreads its copies to other computers. A worm may infect its target through a software vulnerability or it may be delivered via phishing or smishing. Embedded worms can modify and delete files, inject more malicious software, or replicate in place until the targeted system runs out of resources.RootkitsRootkit malware is a collection of software designed to give malicious actors control of a computer network or application. Once activated, the malicious program sets up a backdoor exploit and may deliver additional malware. Bootkits take this a step further by infecting the master boot prior to the operating system booting up, making them harder to detect.Mobile MalwareMobile malware is any type of malware designed to target mobile devices. Mobile malware is delivered through malicious downloads, operating system vulnerabilities, phishing, smishing, and the use of unsecured WiFi.ExploitsAn exploit is a piece of software or data that opportunistically uses a defect in an operating system or an app to provide access to unauthorized actors. The exploit may be used to install more malware or steal data.ScarewareScareware tricks users into believing their computer is infected with a virus. Typically, a user will see scareware as a pop-up warning them that their system is infected. This scare tactic aims to persuade people into installing fake antivirus software to remove the “virus.” Once this fake antivirus software is downloaded, then malware may infect your computer.KeyloggerKeyloggers are tools that record what a person types on a device. While there are legitimate and legal uses for keyloggers, many uses are malicious. In a keylogger attack, the keylogger software records every keystroke on the victim’s device and sends it to the attacker.BotnetBotnet is a network of computers infected with malware that are controlled by a bot herder. The bot herder is the person who operates the botnet infrastructure and uses the compromised computers to launch attacks designed to crash a target’s network, inject malware, harvest credentials, or execute CPU-intensive tasks.MALSPAMMalicious malware (MALSPAM) delivers malware as the malicious payload via emails containing malicious content, such as viruses or malware-infected attachments.Wiper AttackA wiper attack is designed to permanently delete or corrupt data on targeted systems. They are often observed in geopolitical conflicts and in a hacktivism context. Learn More There are many important distinctions between malware and viruses. Learn about the characteristics of these two cyber threats, how a user can identify the type of attack, and how to best resolve it. Read: Malware vs Virus Malware Infection Across Devices All types of device can be infected with malware if they are not properly equipped with an IoT security strategy to protect all devices. Some of devices that can be infected include: PC Malware: There are many malware variants that specifically target PCs, such as Wannacry Ransomware and zero-day exploits.Mac Malware: Contrary to popular belief, Macs can also be infected with malware. There is a relatively new adversary known to evade Mac security countermeasures called CrescentCore. Protect your Mac with a comprehensive security solution ready to protect all endpoints.Android Malware: Mobile phones with an Android operating system are also susceptible to malware attacks, usually hiding in suspicious text messages and emails opened through a mobile email app.iOS Malware: iPhones and iPad tablets operating with an iOS operating system can suffer from a malware attack via social engineering. One of the most common threats for iOS is Pegasus spyware. Download this Falcon Discover for IoT data sheet to learn how it can help address the challenges facing security teams. Download Now 18 Tips to Prevent a Malware AttackFor most businesses, deploying a breach prevention solution or platform that continuously monitors for malware attacks will be the first line of defense.

Watch video (08:03) 7 types of malware Virus Viruses are a subgroup of malware. A virus is malicious software attached to a document or file that supports macros to execute its code and spread from host to host. Once downloaded, the virus will lie dormant until the file is opened and in use. Viruses are designed to disrupt a system's ability to operate. As a result, viruses can cause significant operational issues and data loss. Worms A worm is a type of malicious software that rapidly replicates and spreads to any device within the network. Unlike viruses, worms do not need host programs to disseminate. A worm infects a device through a downloaded file or a network connection before it multiplies and disperses at an exponential rate. Like viruses, worms can severely disrupt the operations of a device and cause data loss. Trojan virus Trojan viruses are disguised as helpful software programs. But once the user downloads it, the Trojan virus can gain access to sensitive data and then modify, block, or delete the data. This can be extremely harmful to the performance of the device. Unlike normal viruses and worms, Trojan viruses are not designed to self-replicate. Spyware Spyware is malicious software that runs secretly on a computer and reports back to a remote user. Rather than simply disrupting a device's operations, spyware targets sensitive information and can grant remote access to predators. Spyware is often used to steal financial or personal information. A specific type of spyware is a keylogger, which records your keystrokes to reveal passwords and personal information. Adware Adware is malicious software used to collect data on your computer usage and provide appropriate advertisements to you. While adware is not always dangerous, in some cases adware can cause issues for your system. Adware can redirect your browser to unsafe sites, and it can even contain Trojan horses and spyware. Additionally, significant levels of adware can slow down your system noticeably. Because not all adware is malicious, it is important to have protection that constantly and intelligently scans these programs. Ransomware Ransomware is malicious software that gains access to sensitive information within a system, encrypts that information so that the user cannot access it, and then demands a financial payout for the data to be released. Ransomware is commonly part of a phishing scam. By clicking a disguised link, the user downloads the ransomware. The attacker proceeds to encrypt specific information that can only be opened by a mathematical key they know. When the attacker receives payment, the data is unlocked. Fileless malware Fileless malware is a type of memory-resident malware. As the term suggests, it is malware that operates from a victim's computer's memory, not from files on the hard drive. Because there are no files to scan, it is harder to detect than traditional malware. It also makes forensics more difficult because the malware disappears when the victim computer is rebooted. In late 2017, the Cisco Talos threat intelligence team posted an example of fileless malware that they called DNSMessenger. What are the benefits of advanced malware protection? Advanced malware can take the form of common malware that has been modified to increase its capability to infect. It can also test for conditions of a sandbox meant to block malicious files and attempt to fool security software into signaling that it is not malware. Advanced malware protection software is designed to prevent, detect, and help remove threats in an efficient manner from computer system.

How it works How does malware work? Malware works by employing trickery to impede the normal use of a device. Once a cybercriminal has gained access to your device through one or more different techniques—such as a phishing email, infected file, system or software vulnerability, infected USB flash drive, or malicious website—they capitalize on the situation by launching additional attacks, obtaining account credentials, collecting personal information to sell, selling access to computing resources, or extorting payment from victims. Anyone can become a victim of a malware attack. Although you may know how to spot some of the ways that attackers target victims with malware, cybercriminals are sophisticated and constantly evolve their methods to keep pace with technology and security improvements. Malware attacks also look and act differently depending on the type of malware. Someone who’s a victim of a rootkit attack, for example, might not even know it, because this type of malware is designed to lay low and remain unnoticed for as long as possible. Types Types of malware There are many types of malware out there—here are a few of the most common. Adware Adware installs itself on a device without the owner’s consent to display or download advertisements, often in popup form to make money off clicks. These ads often slow a device’s performance. More dangerous types of adware can also install additional software, change browser settings, and leave a device vulnerable for other malware attacks. Botnets Botnets are networks of infected devices controlled remotely by attackers. These networks are often used for large-scale attacks like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spamming, or stealing data. Cryptojacking With the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies, mining coins has become a lucrative practice. Cryptojacking involves hijacking a device’s computing power to mine cryptocurrencies without the owner’s knowledge, significantly slowing down the infected system. Infections of this type of malware often begin with an email attachment that attempts to install malware or a website that uses vulnerabilities in web browsers or takes advantage of computer processing power to add malware to devices. Using complex mathematical calculations, malicious cryptojackers maintain the blockchain ledger, or decentralized, digital recordkeeping system, to steal computing resources that allow them to create new coins. Coin mining takes significant computer processing power, however, to steal relatively small amounts of cryptocurrencies. For this reason, cybercriminals often work in teams to maximize and split profits. Not all coin miners are criminals, though—individuals and organizations sometimes purchase hardware and electronic power for legitimate coin mining. The act becomes criminal when a cybercriminal infiltrates a corporate network against its knowledge to use its computing power for mining. Exploits and exploit kits Exploits take advantage of vulnerabilities in software to bypass a computer’s security safeguards and install malware. Malicious hackers scan for outdated systems that contain critical vulnerabilities, then exploit them by deploying malware. By including shellcode in an exploit, cybercriminals can download more malware that infects devices and infiltrates organizations. Exploit kits are automated tools used by cybercriminals to find and exploit known software vulnerabilities, allowing them to launch attacks quickly and efficiently. Software that can be infected includes Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Reader, web browsers, Oracle Java, and Sun Java. Angler/Axpergle, Neutrino, and Nuclear are a few types of common exploit kits. Exploits and exploit kits usually rely on malicious websites or email attachments to breach a network or device, but sometimes they also hide in ads on legitimate websites. Fileless malware This type of cyberattack broadly describes malware that doesn’t rely on files—like an infected email attachment—to breach a network. For example, they might arrive through malicious network packets, or small segments of a larger dataset transferred over a computer network, that exploit a vulnerability and then install malware that lives only in the kernel memory. Fileless threats are especially difficult to find and remove because most antivirus programs aren’t built to scan firmware. Ransomware Ransomware is a type of malware that threatens a victim by destroying or blocking access to critical data until a ransom is paid. Human-operated ransomware attacks target an organization through common system and security misconfigurations that infiltrate the organization, navigate its enterprise network, and adapt to the environment and any weaknesses. A common method of gaining access to an organization’s network to deliver ransomware is through credential theft, in which a cybercriminal could steal an actual employee’s credentials to pose as them and gain access to their accounts. Attackers using human-operated ransomware target large organizations because they can pay a higher ransom than the average individual—often many millions of dollars. Because of the high stakes involved with a breach of this scale, many organizations choose to pay the ransom rather than have their sensitive data leaked or risk further attacks. However, payment doesn’t guarantee the prevention of either outcome. As human-operated ransomware attacks grow, the criminals behind the attacks are becoming more organized. In fact, many ransomware operations now use a “ransomware as a service” model, meaning that a set of criminal developers create the ransomware itself and then hire other cybercriminal affiliates to hack an organization’s network and install the ransomware, splitting the profits between the two groups at an agreed-on rate. Rootkits When a cybercriminal uses a rootkit, they hide malware on a device for as long as possible, sometimes even years, so that it steals information and resources on an ongoing basis. By intercepting and changing standard operating system processes, a rootkit might alter the information that your device reports about itself. For example, a device infected with a rootkit might not show an accurate list of programs that are running. Rootkits might also give administrative or elevated device permissions to cybercriminals, so they gain complete control of a device and can do things like steal data, spy on the victim, and install additional malware. Spyware Spyware collects personal or sensitive information without the user's knowledge, often tracking browsing habits, login credentials, or financial details, which can be used for identity theft or sold to third parties. Supply chain attacks This type of malware targets software developers and providers by accessing source codes, building processes, or updating mechanisms in legitimate apps. Once a cybercriminal has found an unsecured network protocol, unprotected server infrastructure, or unsafe coding practice, they break in, change source codes, and hide malware in build and update processes. When the compromised software is sent on to customers, it infects the customers’ systems as well. Tech support scams An industry-wide issue, tech support scams use scare tactics to trick people into paying for unnecessary technical support services that might be advertised to fix a falsified problem on a device, a platform, or software. With this type of malware, a cybercriminal calls someone directly and pretends to be an employee of a software company or creates clickable advertisements designed to look like system warnings. Once they’ve gained someone’s trust, attackers often urge potential victims to install applications or give remote access to their devices. Trojans Trojans masquerade as legitimate software to trick people into downloading them. Once downloaded, they might:   Download and install additional malware, such as viruses or worms.Use the infected device for click fraud by artificially inflating clicks on a button, ad, or link.Record the keystrokes and websites that you visit.Send information (for example, passwords, login details, and browsing history) about the infected device to a malicious hacker.Give a cybercriminal control over the infected device.   Worms Mostly found in email attachments, text messages, file-sharing programs, social networking sites, network shares, and removable drives, a worm spreads through a network by exploiting security vulnerabilities and copying itself. Depending on the type of worm, it might steal sensitive information, change your security settings, or stop you from accessing files. Unlike viruses, worms don’t require any human interaction to spread—they replicate on their own. Viruses Viruses are one of the oldest forms of malware, designed to disrupt or destroy data on infected devices. They typically infect a system and replicate when a victim opens malicious files or email attachments. Impact The business impact of malware Malware can cause significant harm to businesses, with consequences that extend beyond the initial attack and include:   Financial losses. Financial costs, including ransoms, recovery expenses, and lost revenue during downtime, are a common result of malware attacks.Data breaches and privacy issues. Malware can lead to data theft, compromising sensitive information such as customer data or intellectual property.Operational disruptions. Attacks can bring business operations to a standstill when employees are prevented from accessing critical systems or data.Reputational damage. Public knowledge of an attack can erode trust and damage customer relationships and long-term business prospects. Detection How to detect malware Early detection of malware is critical to minimizing damage to your systems. Malware often shows subtle signs, such as slow performance, frequent crashes, and unexpected pop-ups or programs, which could signal a compromise. Businesses use a variety of tools to detect malware, including antivirus software, firewalls, endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, managed detection and response (MDR) services, extended detection and response (XDR) solutions, and cyber threat hunting processes. While EDR focuses on detecting and responding to threats at the endpoint level, XDR goes beyond endpoints to correlate signals across multiple domains, such as email, identities, and cloud apps, providing a comprehensive view of threats. MDR combines these tools with expert-led monitoring and response services, offering businesses additional support in managing threats. When unusual activity is detected, running full system scans and reviewing logs can help confirm malware’s presence. EDR plays a critical role in this process by identifying and isolating compromised endpoints, while XDR expands detection across the organization, offering end-to-end visibility of attacks. MDR services further enhance this process with continuous monitoring and expert analysis, enabling faster, more effective responses. Together, these tools and services provide a unified approach to detecting and mitigating malware threats, helping businesses limit damage and maintain security. Prevention How to prevent a malware attack Preventing malware requires a proactive approach to security, and removing it effectively depends on early detection and swift action. Organizations can block or detect malware attacks using a combination of antivirus programs and advanced solutions for threat detection and response, which provide a comprehensive way to identify and mitigate threats quickly. Here are some ways to prevent a malware attack: Install an antivirus program The best form of protection is prevention. Organizations can block or detect many malware attacks with a trusted security solution that includes antimalware, such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. When you use a program like these, your device first scans any files or links that you attempt to open to help ensure they’re safe. If a file or website is malicious, the program will alert you and suggest that you not open it. These programs can also remove malware from a device that’s already infected. Implement email and endpoint protections Help prevent malware attacks with XDR solutions like Microsoft Defender for XDR. These unified security incident solutions provide a holistic, efficient way to protect against and respond to advanced cyberattacks. Building on the foundation of MDR, which combines expert-led monitoring with advanced detection tools, XDR takes security to the next level by integrating signals across endpoints, email, identities, and cloud applications. This expanded visibility enables organizations to identify and disrupt sophisticated attacks faster and with greater precision. Also a part of Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses endpoint behavioral sensors, cloud security analytics, and threat intelligence to help organizations prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. Hold regular trainings Keep employees informed about how to spot the signs of phishing and other cyberattacks with training sessions that are regularly updated to cover new developments in attacker tactics. This will teach them not only safer practices for work but also how to be safer when using their personal devices. Simulation and training tools help simulate real-world threats in your environment and assign training to end users based on the results. Take advantage of cloud backups When you move your data to a cloud-based service, you’ll be able to easily back up data for safer keeping. If your data is ever compromised by malware, these services help ensure that recovery is both immediate and comprehensive. Adopt a Zero Trust model A Zero Trust model evaluates all devices and users for risk before permitting them to access applications, files, databases, and other devices, decreasing the likelihood that a malicious identity or device could access resources and install malware. As an example, implementing multifactor authentication, one component of a Zero Trust model, has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of identity attacks by more than 99%. To evaluate your organization’s Zero Trust maturity stage, take our Zero Trust Maturity Assessment. Join an information-sharing group Information-sharing groups, usually organized by industry or geographic location, encourage similarly structured organizations to work together toward cybersecurity solutions. The groups also offer organizations additional benefits, such as incident response and digital forensics services, news about the latest threats, and monitoring of public IP ranges and domains. Maintain offline backups Because some malware will try to seek out and delete any online backups you have, it’s a good idea to keep an updated offline backup of sensitive data that you regularly test to make sure it’s restorable if you’re ever hit by a malware attack. Keep software up to date In addition to keeping any antivirus solutions updated (consider choosing automatic updates to simplify this), be sure to download and install any other system updates and software patches as soon as they’re available. This helps minimize any security vulnerabilities that a cybercriminal might exploit to gain access to your network or devices. Create an incident response plan An incident response plan will provide you with steps to take in different attack scenarios so that you can get back to running normally and safely as soon as possible. Response Detecting and responding to a malware attack Malware isn’t always easily detectable, especially in the case of fileless malware. It’s a good idea for organizations and individuals alike to keep an eye out for an increase in popup ads, web browser redirects, suspicious posts on social media accounts, and messages about compromised accounts or device security. Changes to a device’s performance, such as it running much more slowly, might also be a sign of malware infection. For more sophisticated attacks against organizations that antivirus programs are unable to detect and block, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) tools provide security professionals with cloud-powered endpoint security methods that help detect and respond to attacks on endpoint devices. Because these types of attacks are multifaceted, with cybercriminals targeting more than just control of devices, SIEM and XDR help organizations see an attack’s bigger picture across all domains—including devices, emails, and applications. Using SIEM and XDR tools, such as Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender XDR, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, provides antivirus capabilities. Security professionals should ensure that device settings are always updated to match the latest recommendations to help prevent malware threats. One of the most important steps to take to prepare for a malware attack is to develop an incident response plan—a detailed, structured approach that organizations use to manage and mitigate the impact of cyberattacks, including malware infections. It outlines specific steps for identifying, containing, and eradicating threats, as well as recovering from the damage caused. Having a well-defined incident response plan helps businesses minimize downtime, reduce financial loss, and protect sensitive data by ensuring that all team members know their roles and responsibilities during a cyber crisis. This proactive preparation is key to maintaining business continuity. If you’re worried that you’ve become a victim of a malware attack, fortunately, you have options for detection and removal. Immediate steps to take include:   Running antivirus products, like the one offered natively in Windows, to scan for any malicious programs or code. If the program detects malware, it'll list the type and provide suggestions for removal. After removal, be sure to keep the software updated and running to prevent future attacks.Isolating affected systems. Keep malware from spreading by powering down the affected system or disabling the system’s network connectivity. Since malicious attackers might be monitoring organizational communications for evidence that their attack was detected, use atypical devices and methods—like phone calls or in-person meetings—to discuss next steps.Notifying stakeholders. Follow the notification guidance in your incident response plan to initiate containment, mitigation, and recovery procedures. You should also report the incident to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, your local Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) field office, the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center, or your local US Secret Service field office. Ensure compliance with data breach laws and industry regulations to avoid further liabilities. Emerging trends Emerging trends in malware As technology evolves, malware continues to adapt, becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. Understanding future trends helps businesses stay ahead of threats. Emerging types of malware are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often designed to bypass traditional security measures through obfuscation techniques. These techniques include polymorphic malware, which changes its code structure with each infection, making it harder to detect. Another example is malware that hides in legitimate processes or uses encryption to disguise its malicious payload. Fileless malware, which operates directly in memory without leaving a footprint, also evades detection by traditional antivirus programs. To combat these evolving threats, organizations need advanced solutions like AI-powered tools for cybersecurity that not only enhance detection and prevention efforts but also enable automatic attack disruption. These tools can isolate infected devices and suspend compromised accounts in real time, stopping threats in progress and limiting damage. These tools improve detection rates by spotting anomalies or unusual behaviors that might indicate an attack, even before traditional methods would detect them. AI models can also predict potential threats by learning from previous attacks, enabling pre-emptive measures. Additionally, machine learning algorithms continuously refine detection capabilities, helping security teams stay ahead of evolving threats by predicting and preventing attacks before they happen.

A guide to firewalls, types of firewalls, and what to look for in a firewall solution. Free Firewall Assessment 2025 THREAT LANDSCAPE REPORT Firewall Definition Hybrid Mesh Firewall Firewall Solutions Fortinet Products & Services FAQs Firewall Definition Firewall Definition Hybrid Mesh Firewall Firewall Solutions Fortinet Products & Services FAQs Firewall Definition: What Is A Network Firewall? A firewall is a network security device designed to monitor, filter, and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The primary purpose of a firewall is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks. Firewalls come in both hardware and software forms, and they work by inspecting data packets and determining whether to allow or block them based on a set of rules. Organizations can configure these rules to permit or deny traffic based on various criteria, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol type. Understanding firewalls and network security Firewalls are the bedrock of network security, shielding the network from unauthorized access. They prevent bad actors — hackers, bots, and other threats — from overloading or infiltrating a private network to steal sensitive data. Traditionally, firewalls regulate traffic by forming a secure perimeter around a network or computer. This prevents anyone from accessing network resources if they aren’t authorized to do so. Without this protection, virtually anybody could enter and do as they please. Today's cybersecurity landscape demands a layered approach. While firewalls remain a cornerstone of network defense, advanced threats require additional security measures. The rise of cloud computing and hybrid work environments further highlights the need for comprehensive security solutions. Fortunately, cutting-edge firewall technologies with AI-powered services are bringing network security up to speed. Combining the strengths of traditional tools with the innovative capabilities of new solutions, modern firewall vendors help organizations defend against even the most complex attack strategies. What Does A Firewall Do? Firewalls protect against malicious traffic. They’re strategically positioned at the network edge or in a data center, allowing them to closely monitor anything attempting to cross this boundary. This visibility also allows a network firewall to granularly inspect and authenticate data packets in real time. This involves checking the data packet against predefined criteria to determine whether it poses a threat. If it fails to meet the criteria, the firewall blocks it from entering or leaving the network. Firewalls regulate both inbound and outbound traffic, protecting the network from: External threats such as viruses, backdoors, phishing emails, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Firewalls filter incoming traffic flows, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and thwarting potential malware infections. Insider threats like known bad actors or risky applications. A firewall can enforce rules and policies to restrict certain types of outgoing traffic, which helps identify suspicious activity and mitigate data exfiltration. Firewall vs antivirus explained What’s the difference between firewall and antivirus software? Firewalls focus on controlling network traffic and preventing unauthorized access. By contrast, antivirus programs target and eliminate threats at the device level. More specifically, their key differences include: Scope: Antivirus software is primarily an endpoint solution, meaning it’s installed on an individual device. Firewalls mainly deploy at the network level, but some organizations install hosted firewalls directly on an endpoint for extra protection. Functionality: Firewalls monitor traffic, blocking malicious data before it enters the network (or endpoint). Antivirus tools scan the local environment for signs of malware, ransomware, and other infectious attacks. Enterprises normally deploy both firewalls and antivirus programs. As complementary solutions, they each provide essential protective layers for safeguarding business assets. Firewall Functions: NAT And VPN Network Address Translation (NAT) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) are two distinct technologies, each with its own set of functions related to network security and connectivity. While NAT is primarily associated with address translation for routing purposes, VPNs are used to create secure, encrypted connections over the internet. NAT NAT changes the destination or source addresses of data packets as they pass through a firewall. This allows multiple devices to connect to the internet using the same IP address, which helps protect the private network from direct exposure to external threats. In an office environment, each employee uses their own computer or mobile device to access the internet for browsing, emailing, and accessing cloud services. Despite each device having its own private IP address within the company's internal network, all outbound traffic appears to external networks as originating from the same public IP address assigned to the company. As a result, it’s harder for potential attackers to identify and target individual devices. VPN A VPN is a type of proxy server. Therefore, it serves as a barrier between a computer or network and the internet, receiving all web requests before forwarding them to the network. VPNs are common and extend the private network across a public one, such as the internet. This allows users to securely transmit data as if their devices were directly connected to the private network. The connection establishes an encrypted tunnel between remote devices and the corporate network, enabling secure access. This function is especially useful in a hybrid environment. Remote employees can leverage VPNs to access corporate networks and critical applications regardless of where or how they’re working. Click to See Larger Image Firewalls have evolved through four distinct phases: First-generation firewalls began in 1989 with the packet filtering approach. These firewalls examine individual data packets, making decisions to allow or block them based on predefined rules. However, these were unable to identify if those packets contained malicious code (i.e., malware). Second-generation firewalls began in the early 2000s. Otherwise known as stateful firewalls, these track the state of active connections. By observing network traffic, they use context to identify and act on suspicious behavior. Unfortunately, this generation also has its limitations. Third-generation firewalls emerged in the latter half of the early 2000s. Often called proxy firewalls or application-level gateways, these act as intermediaries between a client and server, forwarding requests and filtering responses. Fourth-generation firewall, also known as next-generation firewall (NGFW), started in 2010. NGFWs combine traditional capabilities with new, advanced features such as intrusion prevention (IPS), application-layer filtering, and advanced threat detection. Although each generation improved upon the last, many earlier iterations are still in use today. Let’s review the benefits of each firewall in more detail. Click to See Larger Image Stateless firewalls A stateless firewall protects the network by analyzing traffic in the transport layer protocol — the place where devices communicate with one another. Rather than store information about the state of the network connection, it inspects traffic on a packet-by-packet basis. Then, it decides to block or allow the traffic based on the data located in the “packet header.” This may include source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, and other information. Altogether, this process is called packet filtering. Despite being fast and inexpensive, stateless firewalls can be exposed to common network vulnerabilities. Critically, they have zero visibility into packet sequencing. That means they can’t detect illegitimate packets, which may contain attack vectors or not have a corresponding request. Likewise, they only have insight into the packet header — not its actual contents. This makes it impossible for a stateless firewall to detect malware hidden within a packet’s payload. Click to See Larger Image Statefull firewalls Stateful firewalls track the most recent or immediate status of active connections. Monitoring the state and context of network communications can help identify threats based on more insightful information. For example, state-aware firewalls block or allow traffic by analyzing where it’s coming from, where it’s going, and the contents of its data packets. Moreover, they evaluate the behavior of data packets and network connections, cataloging patterns and using this information to improve future threat detection. This approach offers more protection compared to packet filtering but takes a greater toll on network performance because it conducts a more in-depth analysis. Worse yet, attackers can trick stateful inspection firewalls into letting harmful connections sneak through. They exploit network rules and send malicious packets using protocols the firewall believes to be safe. Application-Level Gateways Application-level gateways, or proxy firewalls, act as an intermediary between internal and external systems. Notably, they operate at Layer 7 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model — the application layer. As the closest layer to the end-user, Layer 7 applications include web browsers, email clients, and instant messaging tools. Proxy firewalls intercept and analyze all incoming and outgoing traffic, applying granular security policies to control access and protect the network. They offer packet filtering, application-level inspection, URL filtering, and more. Next-Generation Firewall Click to See Larger Image NGFWs protect businesses against emerging cyber threats. They blend all the best parts of past firewall technologies with the advanced capabilities required to mitigate modern cyberattacks. For example, these include: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), a method of examining the contents of data packets as they pass through network checkpoints. DPI analyzes a larger range of information, allowing it to find otherwise hidden threats. Intrusion Prevention (IPS), a system that monitors traffic in real time to proactively identify threats and automate response. Data Loss Prevention (DLP), a cybersecurity solution that blocks intentional and accidental data disclosures. NGFWs combine the protection of previous generations with the advanced security capabilities mentioned above. They can be deployed as software or hardware and can scale to any location: remote office, branch, campus, data center, and cloud. This includes mission-critical OT environments where deploying a rugged firewall ensures reliable protection against extreme environmental challenges. NGFWs can simplify, unify, and automate enterprise-grade protection with centralized management that extends across distributed environments. These capabilities include: Internet of Things (IoT) security to discover BYOD, rogue, or shadow IT devices. Network sandboxing to monitor and analyze suspicious objects in an isolated environment Zero-trust network access (ZTNA) to manage network access to users and applications based on identity and context Operational technology (OT) security to protect OT environments with cyber threat intelligence platform, IPS, and SCADA applications and threat inspection Domain Name System (DNS) security to monitor, detect and prevent capabilities against DNS layer attacks Software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN) architecture to deliver dynamic path selection, based on business or application policy, centralized policy and management of appliances, virtual private network (VPN), and zero-touch configuration. 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Hybrid Mesh Firewall Fortinet Recognized as a Leader and Placed Highest in Ability to Execute Access Now Firewall Trends: Hybrid Mesh Firewall Click to See Larger Image Hybrid mesh firewalls are emerging as the next frontier of network security. In brief, a hybrid mesh firewall is a security platform that provides centralized and unified management by combining the benefits of multiple firewall architectures. It simplifies cybersecurity operations and coordinates policies across firewalls of all form factors to create a comprehensive security posture. With the rise of work-from-anywhere, employees are more distributed than ever before. And, to accommodate remote work setups, organizations have greatly accelerated their digital transformations. They’ve adopted hybrid cloud environments, stretching the network edge far past its former perimeter. Between cloud services, data centers, branch offices, and remote deployments, managing network traffic is exponentially more difficult. Adding to the mix is the fact that enterprise attack surfaces are quickly expanding. Whether it be remote employees accessing corporate resources on unmanaged devices or a disjointed array of point solutions and cloud applications, every new connection is another potential entry point bad actors can exploit. And, at a time when organizations are facing a significant cybersecurity skills gap, hackers only grow more sophisticated. Click to See Larger Image In turn, organizations must find a way to unify their cybersecurity approach and simplify risk management. Why Hybrid Mesh Firewall? By simplifying cybersecurity operations and coordinating security policies across all firewalls, hybrid mesh firewalls create a comprehensive security posture that is ideal to secure distributed network environments. According to Gartner, hybrid mesh firewall platforms address the growing complexity of implementing and managing firewalls across multiple use cases. Hybrid mesh firewalls offer mature, cloud-based, unified management with automation and orchestration capabilities. Features such as application connectivity mapping, visibility into cloud-native network security policies, policy fine-tuning, and recommendations facilitate the administration of all firewall complaints across hybrid environments. Integration with overlapping technologies such as microsegmentation and SASE provide mature visibility and risk management capabilities. A hybrid mesh architecture spans distributed network environments unifying operations, security, and management of multi-deployment firewalls including hardware and virtual appliances, cloud-based, and as-a-service form factors. One of the most critical capabilities of an NGFW is to simplify the management of these dispersed network firewalls with consistent security across complex, hybrid environments. Hybrid mesh firewalls include multiple form factors, such as: Virtual firewalls: Software-based firewalls that run on virtualized infrastructure, such as hypervisors or cloud platforms. Protect virtualized environments and can be moved between clouds. Critically, they’re flexible by nature, allowing organizations to deploy them to various public or private clouds. Cloud-native firewalls: Firewalls specifically created to operate in particular cloud environments. They’re often tightly integrated with cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services, Azure, and Google Cloud. This reduces the workload for network security teams, as it eliminates the need to configure and maintain the software infrastructure. Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS): A deployment model where vendors deliver the firewall solution as a cloud-based service. This makes it easy to scale across a growing network infrastructure and is easily configured to match an enterprise’s unique security needs. As network risk management becomes more complex, hybrid mesh firewalls stand to level the playing field for enterprises by unifying operations, security, and management across distributed network environments. Click to See Larger Image What To Look For In A Firewall Solution Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) serve as gatekeepers to safeguard an organization’s compute resources with secure networking, advanced threat inspection and detection, and web filtering. Hybrid working models and the rapid adoption of cloud services are forcing network security to evolve to give enterprises complete visibility and control across the entire distributed infrastructure. When evaluating NGFW solutions, potential trade-offs between security and performance may be top of mind. The ability to provide consistent and consolidated security protection across all distributed edges with minimal performance impact is critical. Following are six criteria to consider when evaluating NGFWs for a distributed security edge to edge. 6 Criteria for evaluating NGFWs for high-performance security 1. Integrated AI-Powered Security Services. NGFWs that are tightly integrated with AI-powered security services provide real-time threat intelligence with multi-layered security that includes network intrusion prevention, malware scanning, and web filtering for comprehensive protection. AI-powered security services complement traditional firewall capabilities with proactive threat detection against evolving threats including machine learning. This reduces the workload for security teams, improves security efficiency and resource allocation, and streamlines security management for better decision making. Machine learning can analyze vast amounts of data to identify anomalous patterns that might indicate malicious activity. This enables the NGFW to dynamically adapt security policies based on real-time network traffic analysis. This ensures that relevant and effective security measures are applied, reducing the risk of cyberattacks. 2. Threat protection performance. Threat protection performance is a measurement of how well an NGFW performs while running full threat protection, including firewalling, intrusion prevention, antivirus, and application control. It is critical for the NGFW to sustain high performance when full threat protection is turned on. Many NGFW providers are ambiguous about how they represent their threat protection performance claims. Documented performance claims should be examined carefully to ensure they reflect testing under load, with threat protection fully engaged. 3. Single-pane-of-glass management. The management interface is where many security architects are stymied in their selection process. Careful attention may have been paid to the management system’s user interface and functionality, but if it is limited to the NGFW, security teams will have to toggle between multiple dashboards to assess vulnerabilities and respond to threats. End-to-end visibility and control are possible only if the NGFW is part of a broad, integrated security architecture, across which it can share threat information with other network devices and receive threat intelligence automatically. Single-pane-of-glass management is more effective from a security standpoint and is operationally more efficient, reducing administrative time and training costs. 4. Ensure a broader security strategy. The hybrid workforce has forever changed the cybersecurity landscape. In addition, organizations have distributed offices that depend on redundant WAN connections and organizations now require additional security solutions like SD-WAN, Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE). Many NFGW vendors have add-on SD-WAN, SASE, and ZTNA features to allow organizations with branch offices to build highly available and high-performance networks. However, these offers are not ideal. Look for a vendor that offers fully integrated secure SD-WAN, SASE, and ZTNA capabilities in NGFWs that help consolidate their point products and enforce centralized control. This reduces overall investment costs, while eliminating security gaps. 5. Price/performance and other operational considerations. Some vendors scale performance by increasing the size, and consequently, the price of their NGFWs. This may not align with enterprise trends toward shrinking technology footprints. Aim for an NGFW that delivers the required performance in the most compact form factor. This not only reduces total cost of ownership (TCO) but it also saves space and reduces energy consumption—both important objectives for environmentally conscious enterprises. Maintenance and support costs for the NGFW should be factored into TCO, too. Mature technology has an edge in this respect, as does an offering from a vendor with deep investments in research and design. Owners of NGFWs that fall into this category can expect smoother deployments and fewer support calls. When considering the NGFW hardware, pay attention to power redundancy and support for 40 GbE and 100 GbE network interfaces. These will support resiliency and accommodate migration to higher-capacity networks. 6. Independent third-party validation. Although network security is a rapidly evolving industry, no enterprise can afford the risk of untested security innovations. Architects should not rely on vendor claims alone but seek third-party evaluation from recognized testing houses such as CyberRatings.org. Choosing Your Firewall Deployment Use Cases When choosing a firewall, consider the use case. Are you securing a branch office or ATM, a data center, or your headquarters on campus?

A firewall is the first line of defense that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic and decides to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. See, try, or buy a firewall Explore Cisco firewalls A primer on firewalls A firewall is a network security device that separates a trusted internal network from an external network deemed untrustworthy, such as the internet. It regulates incoming and outgoing network traffic based on preset security rules. Firewalls are paramount in shielding networks from unauthorized access, harmful activities, and potential threats, and can exist as hardware, software, software-as-a-service (SaaS), or public or private (virtual) cloud. Firewalls scrutinize network packets and implement security policies, effectively barring unauthorized users or potentially harmful data from infiltrating or exiting a network. Notably, firewalls serve as gatekeepers, scrutinizing each network packet and deciding whether to permit or block it based on pre-set rules. This helps to ensure that only traffic deemed safe and legitimate is allowed through the firewall. In addition to these core functions, today's next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) have a range of features to bolster network security. These include deep packet inspection, application visibility and control, intrusion detection and prevention, malware defense, URL filtering, and more. Cisco Secure Firewall: First line of defense Watch now (02:27) Types of firewalls Packet filtering firewall These firewalls scrutinize each packet of data that passes through them, and then filters them based on parameters like source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol types. While these firewalls are relatively simple and cost-effective, they are unable to examine the contents of packets, which makes them less effective against sophisticated attacks. Proxy firewall A proxy firewall is an early type of firewall device, serving as the gateway from one network to another for a specific application. Proxy servers can provide additional functionality, such as content caching and security, by preventing direct connections from outside the network. However, this also may impact throughput capabilities and the applications they can support. Stateful inspection firewall Now considered a traditional firewall, a stateful inspection firewall allows or blocks traffic based on state, port, and protocol. It monitors all activity from the opening of a connection until it is closed. Filtering decisions are made based on both administrator-defined rules as well as context, which refers to using information from previous connections and packets belonging to the same connection. Web application firewall (WAF) Web application firewalls act as intermediaries for internal and external networks, handling all communication requests on behalf of the internal network. They offer a high level of security, as they can inspect the content of packets and filter out malicious or unauthorized data. However, their reliance on proxy servers can introduce latency and impact network performance. Unified threat management (UTM) firewall A UTM device typically combines, in a loosely coupled way, the functions of a stateful inspection firewall with intrusion prevention and antivirus. It may also include additional services and often cloud management. UTMs focus on simplicity and ease of use. Explore UTM devices Next-generation firewall (NGFW) A next-generation firewall (NGFW) is a network security device that provides capabilities beyond a traditional, stateful firewall. While a traditional firewall typically provides stateful inspection of incoming and outgoing network traffic, a next-generation firewall includes additional features like application awareness and control, intrusion prevention system (IPS), URL filtering based on geolocation and reputation, and threat intelligence. An NGFW can ease administration and reduce complexity with unified policies that protect across the entire attack continuum. Explore next-generation firewalls AI-powered firewall AI-powered firewalls use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance threat protection and network security. While traditional firewalls use predetermined rules to block and detect threats, AI-powered firewalls work in real time to analyze dynamic network traffic, identify patterns, and help organizations automate lifecycle management of their firewall policy. Watch Cisco AI in Firewall video (01:29) Virtual firewall A virtual firewall is typically deployed as a virtual appliance. It can be hosted on-premises in a private cloud environment based on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM, OpenStack, and Nutanix. A virtual firewall can also be deployed in a public cloud infrastructure, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). With a virtual firewall, you can secure your applications and data across the multicloud environments with unified policy controls, centralized management, and advanced threat defense. Explore virtual firewalls for public cloud and private cloud Cloud-native firewall Cloud-native firewalls modernize the way to secure applications and workload infrastructure at scale. With automated scaling features, cloud-native firewalls enable networking operations and security operations teams to run at agile speeds. A cloud-native firewall supports agile and elastic security, multi-tenant capability, and smart load balancing. Mechanics of firewalls Understanding how firewalls function is critical for both businesses and individuals looking to strengthen their cybersecurity measures. Firewalls operate based on predefined rules. When data packets travel through a network, the firewall scrutinizes the packet headers and compares them against the established rules. If a packet matches a rule, it is either allowed or denied based on the policy in place. Stateful inspection is an advanced firewall technology that monitors the state of network connections, allowing it to make more informed decisions about which packets to permit or block. By observing the entire communication session, stateful inspection firewalls can detect and prevent various types of attacks, such as IP spoofing and session hijacking. Deep packet inspection elevates firewall security by analyzing the actual content of packets in addition to the header information. This capability allows firewalls to inspect the payload of packets, enabling them to identify and block specific types of traffic, such as malicious code or prohibited file types. Firewall policies and configurations shape the behavior of a firewall and determine what traffic it permits or blocks. It is essential to regularly review and update these to align with your organization's security requirements. Significance of firewalls Implementing a firewall can significantly enhance the security of your network and sensitive data. Firewalls offer protection against common network threats and attacks, making them indispensable in the face of increasing sophistication of cyberthreats. Beyond network security, firewalls also aid organizations in meeting compliance requirements and adhering to industry best practices. Many regulatory frameworks mandate the use of firewalls to protect sensitive customer information. By implementing a firewall, organizations can meet these compliance requirements and avoid potential penalties. Selecting the right firewall requires careful consideration of such factors as the required level of security, network performance, scalability, and ease of management. It is vital to assess your organization's unique needs and consult with IT professionals to choose the firewall solution that is most suitable for your organization. How USGA increased business resilience by switching to Cisco Secure Firewall Watch now (01:20) Best practices for firewalls Implementing best practices for firewalls is key to securing your network. It is critical to appropriately configure and manage firewalls, implement regular updates and patches, and monitor and audit firewall activity. Configuring and managing firewall rules Proper configuration of firewall rules is essential for effective network security. Regularly review and update these rules to ensure they align with your organization's changing needs and evolving threat landscape. Regular firewall updates and patches Like any other software, firewalls require regular updates and patches to address vulnerabilities and safeguard optimal performance. Implement a consistent update and patch management process to minimize the risk of security breaches and potential exploits. Explore the top five reasons to refresh a firewall Monitoring and auditing firewall activity Regularly reviewing firewall logs and alerts can help identify any suspicious or unauthorized activities. Additionally, consider implementing real-time monitoring solutions that can detect and respond to potential threats promptly. Auditing firewall configurations and policies can help identify misconfigurations or rule conflicts that may leave your network exposed. Following these best practices can significantly enhance the security of your network and protect your valuable data. Related security topics What is a WAF?

Firewall FAQs close Firewalls act as barriers between private and external networks, checking and filtering data based on set security rules. Using these rules, firewalls decide if they should allow, block, or drop the data to protect the network. Form factors include hardware, software, or a mix of both. This process ensures only safe, legitimate traffic gains entry. What do firewalls do, and how do they work? \"A firewall acts a lot like a secretary for your network. The firewall examines requests for access to your network, and it decides whether they pass a reasonableness test. If so, they are allowed through, and, if not, they are refused entry.\"- Mark Stamp, Information Security: Principles and Practice Firewalls monitor and manage network traffic. Their job is to protect network devices (also referred to as hosts). That can mean computers, servers, or anything else with an IP address. Basically, firewalls filter traffic to determine what should be allowed and what should be blocked. To break it down further, a firewall uses rules to make those decisions. Rules can be based on IP addresses, protocols, ports, or other packet-level details. If a packet violates the rules, the firewall blocks it. More advanced firewalls don't just look at packets one by one. Instead, they use stateful inspection, which means they track the entire session that a packet belongs to. That way, they can understand if packet behavior is expected or unusual. Like this: This matters because looking at the full context helps detect more complex or stealthy threats. Firewalls also rely on threat intelligence. They compare traffic against databases of known malicious signatures. If a match is found, the firewall blocks the traffic. They also treat traffic differently based on direction. North-south traffic comes from outside the network and is more likely to carry threats, so it's inspected closely. East-west traffic moves within the network and is often overlooked—but if attackers get in, they can use it to move laterally. Which is why inspecting internal traffic matters too. Not to mention: Firewalls help enforce access control. Most organizations today follow the principle of least privilege so that users and devices only get access to what they need. No more, no less. It's one of the most effective ways to limit risk. | Further reading: What Does a Firewall Do? | How Firewalls Work What Are Firewall Rules? | Firewall Rules Explained The History of Firewalls | Who Invented the Firewall? What are the different types of firewalls? Not all firewalls work the same way. Some protect individual devices. Others monitor traffic for an entire network. Some are physical appliances. Others run in the cloud. That's why they're generally categorized based on what they protect, how they're deployed, where they sit in the network, or how they inspect traffic. Below, we'll break down the main types of firewalls across each of these categories: Types of firewalls Category Type Description Systems protected Network firewall Protects an entire network by inspecting incoming and outgoing traffic. Host-based firewall Installed on a specific device to monitor traffic to and from that host. Form factors Hardware firewall A physical device placed between network elements and connected devices. Software firewall A software-based firewall deployed on servers or virtual machines. Includes container firewalls, virtual firewalls, and managed service firewalls. Placement within infrastructure Perimeter firewall Placed at the edge of a network to manage traffic entering or leaving. Internal firewall Positioned within the network to monitor traffic between internal segments. Distributed firewall A scalable approach where enforcement is applied across multiple devices. Hybrid mesh firewall Firewalls deployed across on-premises and cloud environments in a coordinated, distributed architecture. Data filtering method Packet filtering firewall Checks each packet against rule sets and allows or blocks based on criteria. Stateful inspection firewall Tracks the state of active connections to evaluate traffic in context. Circuit-level gateway Verifies session-level connections before allowing ongoing communication. Proxy firewall Intercepts and evaluates application-layer traffic between client and server. Next-generation firewall (NGFW) Combines traditional firewall features with advanced capabilities like IPS and traffic decryption. Web application firewall Filters HTTP traffic to and from web apps to block attacks like cross-site scripting or SQL injection. These distinctions aren't just technical trivia. They reflect how firewalls have adapted to different layers, architectures, and threats. Knowing the differences helps you make sense of where each firewall fits and what problems it's designed to solve. | Further reading: Types of Firewalls Defined and Explained Layer 3 vs Layer 7 Firewall: What Are the Differences? What features do firewalls include? Firewalls have evolved. What started as basic traffic filtering has grown into a wide range of capabilities designed to meet different levels of risk. Some firewall features are foundational: packet filtering, logging, access control, etc. Others are more advanced, using modern technologies like deep learning and automation to stop sophisticated threats in real time. Let's break down the primary firewall features into two categories—basic and advanced—and take a closer look at each: Firewall features Category Feature Description Basic Packet filtering Evaluates packets based on criteria like IP address or port to allow or block traffic. Stateful inspection Tracks the state of active connections to allow only legitimate traffic. Network Address Translation (NAT) Modifies packet IP addresses to conserve addresses and hide internal network structure. Logging and monitoring Records network activity for analysis and response to potential threats. Access control Applies rules to regulate which users or systems can access network resources. Advanced Advanced threat prevention Uses deep learning to detect zero-day attacks and automate protection workflows. Advanced URL filtering Uses real-time deep learning to stop known and unknown web threats. DNS security Applies ML and analytics to block advanced DNS-based attacks and reduce tool sprawl. IoT security Segments and protects IoT devices using Zero Trust and contextual machine learning. Next-generation CASB Secures SaaS apps in real time with deeper visibility and modern data protection. On paper, many firewalls advertise similar features. But the depth, accuracy, and integration of those features vary widely. What matters most is how well they work together to detect, prevent, and respond to modern threats in real time. | Further reading: What Are the Top Firewall Features? | Traditional & NGFWs What Makes a Strong Firewall? What benefits do firewalls provide? Firewalls help control traffic, reduce risk, and support compliance. Some benefits are well established, like blocking malicious traffic, enforcing access controls, and maintaining data privacy. Others reflect relatively newer capabilities: inspecting encrypted traffic, applying Zero Trust policies across the network, etc. In other words: The value of a firewall depends on what it can do and how it's used. Below, we've grouped firewall benefits into basic protections and more advanced capabilities that support today's hybrid and threat-rich environments. Firewall benefits Category Benefit Description Basic Monitoring and filtering network traffic Inspects data packets and blocks harmful patterns using stateful inspection. Preventing virus infiltration Blocks known virus patterns and supports antivirus tools. NGFWs improve detection of advanced threats. Blocking unauthorized access Applies access controls to limit interactions to trusted sources only. Upholding data privacy Prevents sensitive data exposure by monitoring inbound and outbound traffic. Supporting regulatory compliance Logs and controls access to sensitive data to support audit readiness and compliance. Advanced Enhanced user identity protection Applies security policies based on user identity for more precise access control. Control over application use Identifies and restricts app usage to approved applications only. Encrypted traffic security without privacy compromise Inspects encrypted traffic for threats while preserving user privacy. Advanced threat protection Protects against known and emerging threats across multiple attack vectors. Automated threat intelligence sharing Detects and responds to threats using shared global intelligence feeds. Zero Trust principles Applies continuous authentication and verification to reduce implicit trust. Not every firewall delivers every benefit listed here. That's because firewalls are used in many different environments. What matters is aligning capabilities with your network architecture, threat landscape, and operational needs. | Further reading: What Are the Benefits of a Firewall? What challenges come with using firewalls? Firewalls aren't just a set-it-and-forget-it technology. They need to keep up with evolving threats, shifting traffic patterns, and changing business needs. One of the first challenges is choosing the right type of firewall for each environment. Whether that's a data center, public cloud, branch, or hybrid setup. From there, the real work begins. Misconfigurations are one of the most common and dangerous issues. Whether it's overly permissive rules, missing updates, or traffic filtering mistakes that leave gaps or create bottlenecks. Plus, firewall rule sets grow over time. New policies get added, but old ones often remain. That leads to bloated configurations that slow performance, create conflicts, or block legitimate traffic. And tight rules can also cause false positives, which frustrates users and overloads IT teams with unnecessary alerts. Meanwhile, performance demands continue to rise. Deep inspection, encrypted traffic analysis, and advanced features all require processing power. If firewalls aren't properly sized or tuned, throughput suffers. Even updates present risks. Regular patches and threat signature updates are critical. But poorly timed changes can disrupt traffic or introduce new issues. And underlying it all is one consistent challenge: translating business needs into clear, effective firewall rules. That's especially hard during infrastructure changes, when visibility is limited and documentation may be incomplete. Bottom line: Firewall management is an ongoing process. It takes constant tuning, review, and adaptation to keep protections strong without slowing the business down. | Further reading: How to Troubleshoot a Firewall | Firewall Issues & Solutions What Is Firewall Management? | A Comprehensive Guide What Is Firewall Configuration? | How to Configure a Firewall Key Firewall Best Practices How do firewalls compare with other network security technologies? Firewalls are often one of the first tools people think of when it comes to network security. But they're far from the only one. From antivirus to web gateways to access control lists, each tool in the stack plays a distinct role. And while many overlap or integrate with firewalls, they aren't interchangeable. Understanding the differences helps clarify what a firewall does—and doesn't—do. It also helps you spot where it fits in a layered defense strategy. The table below breaks down how firewalls compare to other common technologies across five dimensions: purpose, deployment, traffic visibility, control, and overlap.

The Different Types of Firewalls What is a Firewall? A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet. A firewall’s main purpose is to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out. Get a Personal Firewall Demo 2025 Gartner Report History Firewalls Evolution Types of Firewalls Firewall Protocols Importance Best Practices Inspection NAT & VPN Solution Resources History of Firewalls Firewalls have existed since the late 1980’s and started out as packet filters, which were networks set up to examine packets, or bytes, transferred between computers. Though packet filtering firewalls are still in use today, firewalls have come a long way as technology has developed throughout the decades. Gen 1 Virus Generation 1, Late 1980’s, virus attacks on stand-alone PC’s affected all businesses and drove anti-virus products. Gen 2 Networks Generation 2, Mid 1990’s, attacks from the internet affected all business and drove creation of the firewall. Gen 3 Applications Generation 3, Early 2000’s, exploiting vulnerabilities in applications which affected most businesses and drove Intrusion Prevention Systems Products (IPS). Gen 4 Payload Generation 4, Approx. 2010, rise of targeted, unknown, evasive, polymorphic attacks which affected most businesses and drove anti-bot and sandboxing products. Gen 5 Mega Generation 5, Approx. 2017, large scale, multi-vector, mega attacks using advance attack tools and is driving advance threat prevention solutions. Back in 1993, Check Point CEO Gil Shwed introduced the first stateful inspection firewall, FireWall-1. Fast forward twenty-seven years, and a firewall is still an organization’s first line of defense against cyber attacks. Today’s firewalls, including Next Generation Firewalls and Network Firewalls support a wide variety of functions and capabilities with built-in features, including: Network Threat Prevention Application and Identity-Based Control Hybrid Cloud Support Scalable Performance The Firewalls Evolution Just like the networks they protect, firewalls have undergone a significant amount of change over the last decade. Even the earliest firewall tooling was essential to network security, as their 1980s counterparts first came into existence as packet filtering tools. Early Development: Packet-Filtering Firewalls The first generation of firewalls, introduced in the late 1980s, employed simple packet filtering. These tools examined data packets at the network layer (OSI Layer 3), and filtered the packets that a network responds to through parameters such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols. However, their lack of contextual awareness and overwhelming focus on individual packets made them vulnerable to complex attacks like IP fragmentation. The Emergence of Stateful Inspection The 1990s saw the advent of stateful inspection firewalls, pioneered by Check Point. These second-generation firewalls continuously monitored the state of connections, ensuring that packets were part of an established session. This enhancement significantly bolstered security. Application Layer and Proxy Firewalls Application layer firewalls and proxy firewalls emerged around the same time. The former operated at Layer 7, able to analyze and apply application-specific data and rulesets. They were also highly secure – boasting the ability to completely separate traffic requests from the underlying network architecture – but early models suffered from limited processing power and bad latency. Unified Threat Management (UTM) and Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) The 2010s saw the advent of UTM systems, which sought to combine a firewall’s reactivity with the extra data points from antivirus, intrusion detection, and other enterprise security systems. NGFWs were able to push these integration capabilities by adding deep packet inspection, advanced threat protection, and application-level filtering. Modern Adaptations: Cloud and AI Today, firewalls have adapted to cloud environments and containerized applications, giving rise to Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS). Building upon the foundation of cross-environment data, AI and machine learning are increasingly being deployed for their superior anomaly detection, predictive threat analysis, and adaptive policy enforcement. From static filters to intelligent, context-aware systems, firewalls have continuously evolved to meet the demands of an ever-changing threat landscape. Let’s delve into all the features that make today’s firewalls so critical. The Different Types of Firewalls Packet filtering Packet filtering is a network security technique used in firewalls to control data flow between networks. It evaluates the headers of incoming and outgoing traffic against a set of predefined rules, and then decides whether to allow or block them. Firewall rules are precise directives that form a critical part of firewall configurations. They define the conditions under which traffic is permitted or blocked based on parameters such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and communication protocols. In enterprise environments, these individual rules are nested together to form Access Control Lists (ACLs). When processing traffic, the firewall evaluates each packet against the ACL rules in sequential order. Once a packet matches a rule, the firewall enforces the corresponding action—such as allowing, denying, or rejecting the traffic—without further evaluation of subsequent rules. This structured and methodical approach ensures that network access is tightly controlled and consistent. Proxy service Since firewalls are happy to sit at the edge of a network, a proxy firewall is naturally well-suited to acting as a single point of entry: in doing so, they’re able to assess the validity of each connection. Proxy-service firewalls completely separate the internal and external, by terminating the client connection at the firewall, analyzing the request, and then establishing a new connection with the internal server. Stateful Inspection Stateful packet inspection analyzes the contents of a data packet and compares them to information about packets that have already traversed the firewall. Stateless inspection analyzes each packet in isolation: stateful inspection, on the other hand, pulls in previous device and connection data to further understand network traffic requests. This is more akin to viewing network data as a continuous stream. By maintaining a list of active connections, and evaluating each from a more macroscopic perspective, stateful firewalls are able to assign network behavior to long-term user and device profiles. Web Application Firewall A Web Application Firewall (WAF) wraps around a specific application and examines the HTTP requests being sent to it. Similar to other types of firewall, it then applies predefined rules to detect and block malicious traffic. The components being scrutinized include headers, query strings, and the body of HTTP requests  – all of which contribute to signs of malicious activity. When a threat is identified, the WAF blocks the suspicious request and notifies the security team. AI-Powered Firewall Firewalls are essentially powerful analytical engines: they’re perfectly suited for the implementation of machine learning algorithms. Because ML algorithms are able to ingest and analyze far greater amounts of data far faster than their manual counterparts, AI-powered firewalls have consistently been able to outperform their older counterparts when handling novel (zero day) threats. One of the more common implementations of AI within firewalls, for instance, is User and Endpoint Behavioural Analysis (UEBA). This ingests the historical data from entire networks, and establishes how every user and endpoint typically interacts with it – what resources they use, when they access them, etc. High Availability Firewalls and Hyperscale, Resilient Load-Sharing Clusters A high availability (HA) firewall is designed to maintain network protection even in the event of firewall failure. This is achieved via redundancy, in the form of HA clustering: multiple firewall peers working together to deliver uninterrupted protection. In the event of device failure, the system automatically transitions to a peer device, therefore maintaining seamless network security. Above and beyond traditional ‘high availability’ designs,  many organizations now need hyper scalable and telco-class resilient firewall systems to assure 99.99999%+ uptime and up to 1,000 Gbps of network throughput with full threat prevention.  An intelligent load-sharing firewall design distributes network traffic across a firewall cluster. It can also automatically reallocate additional firewall resources to critical applications during unexpected peak traffic conditions or other predefined triggers, and then reassign those firewall resources back to their original group after conditions are back to normal. This optimizes performance and prevents any single device from becoming overwhelmed, and assures maximum network performance under all conditions. Virtual Firewall Firewalls were traditionally hardware-exclusive, as they needed the heavy CPU power to manually flick through every rule in the ACL. Now, however, that processing power can essentially be outsourced thanks to firewall virtualization. Virtual systems support internal segmentation: where one tool can be used to set up and monitor multiple segmented firewalls, allowing sub-firewalls to have their own security policies and configurations. Virtual firewalls offer many advantages: multi-tenancy environments, for instance, benefit from this segmentation. It also allows for larger organizations to implement network segmentation in a more streamlined way, through one central tool. Other than that, virtual firewalls can offer all the same capabilities as their hardware-based counterparts. Cloud Firewall It’s common to see people conflate virtualized firewalls with cloud firewalls, but there is a distinction: whereas virtual describes the underlying architecture, cloud firewalls refer to the enterprise assets they are protecting. Cloud firewalls are those used to protect organizations’  public and private cloud-based networks. Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) Since cloud virtualization now allows for processing power to be purchased and used remotely, virtual firewalls are now possible. This opens up new possibilities for firewall architecture – one of which is Firewall as a Service (FWaaS). FWaaS, like any SaaS, is a pre-built firewall solution that is deployed through the cloud. Instead of all enterprise traffic being routed and analyzed via an in-house server room, FWaaS’ unique offering is often its global Points of Presence, which allows for more local (and latency-free) firewall deployment. Managed Firewall Finally, it’s all well and good having a firewall – but as we’ll cover shortly, this tool needs continuous refinement and tweaking. Some enterprises find that the human demands of this can quickly overwhelm a lean cybersecurity team. So, many choose to route their traffic via a managed firewall – which is continuously monitored for threats, anomalies, or unusual traffic patterns. These outsourced firewalls can also benefit from the provider’s advanced tooling and threat intelligence. The Importance of Firewall Protocols Even basic firewalls are able to dig into the source, destination, and protocols that every packet is conforming to. But visibility alone doesn’t prevent attacks; firewall rules govern how the firewall tool reacts to each packet – ultimately either allowing it through to the enterprise network, or denying it. These rules are fundamental to maintaining network security by controlling access to and from systems, ensuring that only authorized traffic passes through while malicious or unwanted data is blocked. To save time, most off-the-shelf firewalls offer preconfigured rulesets. After all, many threats are universal, regardless of the specifics of your industry or employees – especially when attackers are able to scan any public-facing networks for common vulnerabilities. By shipping with preconfigured rulesets, modern firewalls allow for an immediate reduction in potential threats that could hit your enterprise; a boon to deployment, allowing administrators to cut a lot of manual setup that a new tool typically demands. This reduces errors and ensures adherence to industry best practices. Why Do We Need Firewalls? Firewalls, especially Next Generation Firewalls, focus on blocking malware and application-layer attacks. Along with an integrated intrusion prevention system (IPS), these Next Generation Firewalls are able to react quickly and seamlessly to detect and combat attacks across the whole network. Firewalls can act on previously set policies to better protect your network and can carry out quick assessments to detect invasive or suspicious activity, such as malware, and shut it down. By leveraging a firewall for your security infrastructure, you’re setting up your network with specific policies to allow or block incoming and outgoing traffic. Firewall Security Best Practices Firewalls aren’t a set-it-and-forget-it solution. The attacks facing your organization are in constant flux, and firewalls that rely solely on manual rule updates demand just as much time and attention. Set Up Rules According to Least Privilege Principles Foundational to effective firewall rule management is the principle of least privilege. It functionally means only traffic that serves a specific, necessary business function is allowed. By adhering to this principle, it’s all but guaranteed that future rule changes minimize risk, maintain greater control over network traffic, and limit unnecessary cross-network communication. Applying this to rules demands that details such as source and destination IP addresses (or ranges) and destination ports are always defined. This is why overly permissive rules like “Any/Any,” need to be replaced with an explicit deny/allow strategy for all inbound and outbound activity. Maintain Up To Date Documentation As pre-configured rules are changed and updated, clear and comprehensive documentation is essential. Anyone on the network security team should easily understand the purpose of each rule from the documentation. At a minimum, you should record details such as the purpose of the rule, the services it affects, the users and devices involved, the date it was implemented, the rule’s expiration date if temporary, and the name of the analyst who created it. Protect the Firewall Itself The firewall isn’t just a critical piece of enterprise safety: it’s the most public-facing piece of any network infrastructure, making unmanaged firewalls themselves a threat. To secure the firewall, a few key best practices are mandatory: insecure protocols like telnet and SNMP should be disabled entirely; configurations and log databases should be backed up; and a stealth rule should be implemented to protect the firewall from network scans. Finally, keep a regular eye on the updates available for the firewall solution. Group Rules – and Networks – into Corresponding Categories Segmenting enterprise networks into corresponding security levels is another foundational best practice for network security, and firewall rules are perfectly well-suited for enforcing these segments. To streamline management, organize rules into categories or sections based on their function or related characteristics. This approach allows you to structure the rules in the most effective order and ensures better oversight. AI-powered firewalls are increasingly able to automate the rules and documentation they’re based on: these massive strides in efficiency are the main reason why NGFWs are replacing their older models. Network Layer vs. Application Layer Inspection Network layer or packet filters inspect packets at a relatively low level of the TCP/IP protocol stack, not allowing packets to pass through the firewall unless they match the established rule set where the source and destination of the rule set is based upon Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and ports. Firewalls that do network layer inspection perform better than similar devices that do application layer inspection. The downside is that unwanted applications or malware can pass over allowed ports, e.g. outbound Internet traffic over web protocols HTTP and HTTPS, port 80 and 443 respectively. The Importance of NAT and VPN Firewalls also perform basic network level functions such as Network Address Translation (NAT) and Virtual Private Network (VPN). Network Address Translation hides or translates internal client or server IP addresses that may be in a “private address range”, as defined in RFC 1918 to a public IP address. Hiding the addresses of protected devices preserves the limited number of IPv4 addresses and is a defense against network reconnaissance since the IP address is hidden from the Internet. Similarly, a virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network within a tunnel that is often encrypted where the contents of the packets are protected while traversing the Internet. This enables users to safely send and receive data across shared or public networks. Next Generation Firewalls and Beyond Next Generation Firewalls inspect packets at the application level of the TCP/IP stack and are able to identify applications such as Skype, or Facebook and enforce security policy based upon the type of application. Today, UTM (Unified Threat Management) devices and Next Generation Firewalls also include threat prevention technologies such as intrusion prevention system (IPS) or Antivirus to detect and prevent malware and threats. These devices may also include sandboxing technologies to detect threats in files.

Encrypted data can only be read or processed after it's been decrypted. Encryption is the basic building block of data security. It is the simplest and most important way to ensure a computer system's information can't be stolen and read by someone who wants to use it for malicious purposes. Data security encryption is widely used by individual users and large corporations to protect user information sent between a browser and a server. That information could include everything from payment data to personal information. Data encryption software, also known as an encryption algorithm or cipher, is used to develop an encryption scheme that theoretically can only be broken with large amounts of computing power. How does encryption work? When information or data is shared over the internet, it goes through a series of network devices worldwide, which form part of the public internet. As data travels through the public internet, there is a chance it could be compromised or stolen by hackers. To prevent this, users can install specific software or hardware to ensure the secure transfer of data or information. These processes are known as encryption in network security. Encryption involves converting human-readable plaintext into incomprehensible text, which is known as ciphertext. Essentially, this means taking readable data and changing it so that it appears random. Encryption involves using a cryptographic key, a set of mathematical values both the sender and recipient agree on. The recipient uses the key to decrypt the data, turning it back into readable plaintext. The more complex the cryptographic key, the more secure the encryption – because third parties are less likely to decrypt it via brute force attacks (i.e. trying random numbers until the correct combination is guessed). Encryption is also used to protect passwords. Password encryption methods scramble your password, so it's unreadable by hackers. What are the most common techniques of encryption? The two most common encryption methods are symmetric and asymmetric encryption. The names refer to whether or not the same key is used for encryption and decryption: Symmetric encryption keys: This is also known as private key encryption. The key used to encode is the same as the one used to decode, making it best for individual users and closed systems. Otherwise, the key must be sent to the receiver. This increases the risk of compromise if it's intercepted by a third party, such as a hacker. This method is faster than the asymmetric method. Asymmetric encryption keys: This type uses two different keys — public and private — that are linked together mathematically. The keys are essentially large numbers that have been paired with each other but aren't identical, hence the term asymmetric. The private key is kept secret by the owner, and the public key is either shared amongst authorized recipients or made available to the public at large. Data encrypted with the recipient’s public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. Examples of encryption algorithms Encryption algorithms are used to turn data into ciphertext. An algorithm uses the encryption key to alter the data in a predictable way so that, even though the encrypted data will appear random, it can be turned back into plaintext by using the decryption key. There are several different types of encryption algorithms designed to suit different purposes. New algorithms are developed when older ones become insecure. Some of the best-known encryption algorithms include: DES encryption DES stands for Data Encryption Standard. This is a now-outdated symmetric encryption algorithm not considered suitable for today's uses. Therefore, other encryption algorithms have succeeded DES. 3DES encryption 3DES stands for Triple Data Encryption Standard. This is a symmetric key algorithm, and the word “triple” is used because data is passed through the original DES algorithm three times during the encryption process. Triple DES is being slowly phased out but still manages to make a dependable hardware encryption solution for financial services and other industries. AES encryption AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard and was developed to update the original DES algorithm. Some of the more common applications of AES algorithm include messaging apps such as Signal or WhatsApp and the file archiver program WinZip. RSA encryption RSA was the first asymmetric encryption algorithm widely available to the public. RSA is popular due to its key length and therefore widely used for secure data transmission. RSA stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman – the surnames of the mathematicians who first described this algorithm. RSA is considered an asymmetric algorithm due to its use of a pair of keys. Twofish encryption Used in both hardware and software, Twofish is regarded as one of the fastest of its kind. Twofish is not patented, making it freely available to anyone who wants to use it. As a result, you’ll find it bundled in encryption programs such as PhotoEncrypt, GPG, and the popular open-source software TrueCrypt. RC4 encryption Used in WEP and WPA, which are encryption protocols commonly used in wireless routers. Asymmetric encryption examples include RSA and DSA. Symmetric encryption examples include RC4 and DES. As well as encryption algorithms, there is also what is known as Common Criteria (CC): This is not an encryption standard, but a set of international guidelines for verifying the product security claims stand up to scrutiny. CC guidelines were created to provide vendor-neutral, third-party oversight of security products. Products under review are submitted voluntarily by vendors, and whole or individual functionalities are examined. When a product is evaluated, its features are tested according to a defined set of standards by product type. Initially, encryption was outside the scope of Common Criteria but is increasingly being included within its security standards. In transit vs at rest encryption: What’s the difference? Data encryption solutions such as data encryption software and cloud data encryption are often categorized based on whether they are designed for data at rest or data in transit: Data encryption in transit Data is considered in transit when moving between devices, such as within private networks or over the internet. During transfer, data is at greater risk because of the need for decryption before transfer and the vulnerabilities of the transfer method itself. Encrypting data during transfer, referred to as end-to-end encryption, ensures that even if the data is intercepted, its privacy is protected. Data encryption at rest Data is considered at rest when it sits on a storage device and is not actively being used or transferred. Data at rest is often less vulnerable than when in transit since device security features restrict access, but it is not immune. Additionally, it often contains more valuable information, so it is a more appealing target for thieves. Encrypting data at rest reduces opportunities for data theft created by lost or stolen devices, inadvertent password sharing, or accidental permission granting. It increases the time it takes to access information and provides valuable time for the data’s owner to discover data loss, ransomware attacks, remotely erased data, or changed credentials. One way to protect data at rest is through TDE. This stands for Transparent Data Encryption and is a technology used by Microsoft, Oracle and IBM to encrypt database files. TDE protects data at rest, encrypting databases both on the hard drive and consequently on backup media. TDE does not protect data in transit. What is end-to-end encrypted data? A term you often hear concerning data encryption is end-to-end encryption. This refers to systems in which only the two users communicating, who both possess keys, can decrypt the conversation. This includes, for example, even the service provider who cannot access end-to-end encrypted data. Resetting end-to-end encrypted data is possible. On an iPhone, for example, this can be necessary if you forget your password to regain access to your device. If you do this, you won’t be able to use any of the previously encrypted backup files. But you can use iTunes to back up your iOS device again and set a new password for your backed up data. Six core benefits of encryption Encryption helps maintain data integrity Hackers don't just steal information; they can also alter data to commit fraud. While it is possible for skilled hackers to alter encrypted data, recipients of the data will be able to detect the corruption – allowing for a quick response. Encryption helps organizations adhere to regulations Many industries – for example, financial services or healthcare providers – have strict regulations about how consumer data is used and stored. Encryption helps organizations meet those standards and ensure compliance. Encryption protects data across devices Most of us use multiple devices in our day-to-day lives, and transferring data from device to device can carry risks. Encryption technology helps protect data across devices, even during transfer. Additional security measures like advanced authentication help to deter unauthorized users. Encryption helps when moving data to cloud storage More and more users and organizations are storing their data in the cloud, which means cloud security is essential. Encrypted storage helps to maintain the privacy of that data. Users should ensure that data is encrypted in-flight, while in use, and at rest in storage. Encryption helps organizations secure offices Many organizations have remote offices, especially post-pandemic. This can pose cybersecurity risks as data is being accessed from several different locations – encryption helps guard against theft or accidental loss of data. Data encryption protects intellectual property. Digital rights management systems encrypt data at rest — in this case, intellectual property such as songs or software—to prevent reverse engineering and unauthorized use or reproduction of copyrighted material. There are many important uses of encryption Most of us encounter encryption every day. Popular uses include: Every time you use an ATM or buy something online with a smartphone, encryption is used to protect the information being relayed. Securing devices, such as encryption for laptops. Most legitimate websites use \"secure sockets layer” (SSL), which is a form of encrypting data when it is being sent to and from a website. This keeps attackers from accessing that data while it is in transit. Look for the padlock icon in the URL bar and the \"s\" in the \"https://\" to ensure you are conducting secure, encrypted transactions online. Your WhatsApp messages are also encrypted, and you may also have an encrypted folder on your phone. Your email can also be encrypted with protocols such as OpenPGP. VPNs – Virtual Private Networks – use encryption, and everything you store in the cloud should be encrypted. You can encrypt your whole hard drive and even make encrypted voice calls. Encryption is used to prove the integrity and authenticity of information using what are known as digital signatures. Encryption is an integral part of digital-rights management and copy protection. Encryption can be used to erase data. Since deleted information can sometimes be brought back using data recovery tools, if you encrypt the data first and throw away the key, the only thing that anybody can recover is the ciphertext and not the original data. Encryption in cyber security is a way of protecting private information from being stolen or compromised. Another important aspect of online safety is using a high-quality antivirus solution, such as Kaspersky Premium, which blocks common and complex threats like viruses, malware, ransomware, spy apps, and the latest hacker tricks.

Learn more about key management, confidential computing, and Google Cloud’s security offerings.Get started for freeEncryption definedAt its most basic level, encryption is the process of protecting information or data by using mathematical models to scramble it in such a way that only the parties who have the key to unscramble it can access it. That process can range from very simple to very complex, and mathematicians and computer scientists have invented specific forms of encryption that are used to protect information and data that consumers and businesses rely on every day. How encryption worksEncryption works by encoding “plaintext” into “ciphertext,” typically through the use of cryptographic mathematical models known as algorithms. To decode the data back to plaintext requires the use of a decryption key, a string of numbers or a password also created by an algorithm. Secure encryption methods have such a large number of cryptographic keys that an unauthorized person can neither guess which one is correct, nor use a computer to easily calculate the correct string of characters by trying every potential combination (known as a brute force attack).One early example of a simple encryption is the “Caesar cipher,” named for Roman emperor Julius Caesar because he used it in his private correspondence. The method is a type of substitution cipher, where one letter is replaced by another letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. To decrypt the coded text, the recipient would need to know the key to the cipher, such as shifting down the alphabet four places and over to the left (a “left shift four”). Thus, every “E” becomes a “Y” and so on.Modern cryptography is much more sophisticated, using strings of hundreds (even thousands, in some cases) of computer-generated characters as decryption keys.Types of encryptionThe two most common types of encryption algorithms are symmetric and asymmetric.Symmetric encryption, also known as a shared key or private key algorithm, uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Symmetric key ciphers are considered less expensive to produce and do not take as much computing power to encrypt and decrypt, meaning there is less of delay in decoding the data. The drawback is that if an unauthorized person gets their hands on the key, they will be able to decrypt any messages and data sent between the parties. As such, the transfer of the shared key needs to be encrypted with a different cryptographic key, leading to a cycle of dependency. Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses two separate keys to encrypt and decrypt data. One is a public key shared among all parties for encryption. Anyone with the public key can then send an encrypted message, but only the holders of the second, private key can decrypt the message. Asymmetric encryption is considered more expensive to produce and takes more computing power to decrypt as the public encryption key is often large, between 1,024 and 2,048 bits. As such, asymmetric encryption is often not suited for large packets of data.Common encryption algorithmsThe most common methods of symmetric encryption include:Data Encryption Standard (DES): An encryption standard developed in the early 1970s, DES was adopted by the US government in 1977. The DES key size was only 56 bits, making it obsolete in today’s technology ecosystem. That being said, it was influential in the development of modern cryptography, as cryptographers worked to improve upon its theories and build more advanced encryption systems.Triple DES (3DES): The next evolution of DES took the cipher block of DES and applied it three times to each data block it encrypted by encrypting it, decrypting it, and then encrypting it again. The method increased the key size, making it much harder to decrypt with a brute force attack. However, 3DES is still considered insecure and has been deprecated by the US National Institute of Standards (NIST) for all software applications beginning in 2023.Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): The most used encryption method today, AES was adopted by the US government in 2001. It was designed on a principle called a “substitution–permutation network” that is a block cipher of 128 bits and can have keys at 128, 192, or 256 bits in length.Twofish: Used in both hardware and software, Twofish is considered the fastest symmetric encryption method. While Twofish is free to use, it’s not patented nor open source. Nevertheless, it’s used in popular encryption applications like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). It can have key sizes up to 256 bits.The most common methods of asymmetric encryption include:RSA: Stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adelman, the trio of researchers from MIT who first described the method in 1977. RSA is one of the original forms of asymmetric encryption. The public key is created by the factoring of two prime numbers, plus an auxiliary value. Anyone can use the RSA public key to encrypt data, but only a person who knows the prime numbers can decrypt the data. RSA keys can be very large (2,048 or 4,096 bits are typical sizes) and are thus considered expensive and slow. RSA keys are often used to encrypt the shared keys of symmetric encryption.Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): An advanced form of asymmetric encryption based on elliptic curves over finite fields. The method provides the robust security of massive encryption keys, but with a smaller and more efficient footprint. For instance, a “256-bit elliptic curve public key should provide comparable security to a 3,072-bit RSA public key.” Often used for digital signatures and to encrypt shared keys in symmetric encryption.Importance of data encryptionPeople encounter encryption every day, whether they know it or not. Encryption is used for securing devices such as smartphones and personal computers, for protecting financial transactions such as making a bank deposit and buying an item from an online retailer, and for making sure messages such as email and texts are private. If you’ve ever noticed that a website’s address starts with “https://” (the “s” means “secure”) it means that the website is using transport encryption. Virtual private networks (VPNs) use encryption to keep data coming and going from a device private from prying eyes. Data encryption is important because it helps protect people’s privacy, and secures data from attackers and other cybersecurity threats. Encryption is often mandatory from a regulatory perspective for organizations such as in healthcare, education, finance and banking, and retail.Encryption performs four important functions:Confidentiality: keeps the contents of the data secretIntegrity: verifies the origin of the message or dataAuthentication: validates that the content of the message or data has not been altered since it was sentNonrepudiation: prevents the sender of the data or message from denying they were the originAdvantages of encryptionProtects data across devicesData is constantly on the move, be it messages between friends or financial transactions. Encryption paired with other security functions like authentication can help keep data safe when it moves between devices or servers.Ensures data integrityIn addition to keeping unauthorized people from seeing the plaintext of data, encryption safeguards the data so that malicious actors cannot use it to commit fraud or extortion, or change important documents. Protects digital transformationsWith more organizations and individuals using cloud storage, encryption plays a key role in protecting that data while it is in-transit to the cloud, once it is at rest on the server, and while it’s being processed by workloads. Google offers different levels of encryption, as well as key management services.Helps meet compliance requirementsMany data privacy and security regulations require strong encryption. That includes healthcare data with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), credit and debit card transactions with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and retail transaction data with the Fair Credit Practices Act (FCPA).Disadvantages of encryptionRansomwareWhile encryption is generally used to protect data, malicious actors can sometimes use it to hold data hostage. If an organization is breached and its data accessed, the actors can encrypt it and hold it ransom until the organization pays to have it released.Key managementEncryption is much less effective if the cryptographic keys that encrypt and decrypt the data are not secure. Malicious actors often concentrate their attacks on obtaining an organization’s encryption keys. In addition to malicious actors, losing encryption keys (such as during a natural disaster that compromises servers) can lock organizations out of important data. This is why a secure key management system is often used by organizations to manage and secure their keys.Quantum computingQuantum computing poses an existential threat to modern encryption techniques. When it is ready, quantum computing will be able to process massive amounts of data in a fraction of the time of normal computers. As such, quantum computing has the potential to break existing encryption. In the future, all organizations will have to adapt encryption techniques by using quantum encryption techniques. Currently, quantum computing is relatively limited and not yet ready to break modern encryption standards. However, NIST has announced their support of four new “quantum-resistant” algorithms that are designed to withstand quantum computer attacks.Solve your business challenges with Google CloudNew customers get $300 in free credits to spend on Google Cloud.Get startedTalk to a Google Cloud sales specialist to discuss your unique challenge in more detail.

Encryption is the process of transforming readable plain text into unreadable ciphertext to mask sensitive information from unauthorized users. Organizations regularly use encryption in data security to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and data breaches. Encryption works by using encryption algorithms to scramble data into an indecipherable format. Only the authorized parties with the right secret key, known as the decryption key, can unscramble the data. Encryption can protect data at rest, in transit and while being processed, regardless of whether the data is in a computer system on-premises or in the cloud. For this reason, encryption has become critical to cloud security efforts and cybersecurity strategies more broadly. According to the IBM® 2025 Cost of a Data Breach report, organizations that use encryption can reduce the financial impact of a data breach by over USD 200,000. Encryption is also increasingly necessary to comply with regulatory requirements and standards like PCI DSS and the GDPR. Investment in encryption is growing as individuals and organizations face escalating threats and cyberattacks. According to recent estimates, the global encryption software market will reach USD 20.1 billion by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 15.1% from 2020 to 2025. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) has changed the encryption landscape. Specifically, organizations are exploring how AI can help optimize key management and enhance encryption algorithms.

Early instances of cryptography and techniques resembling encryption date back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians. Encryption was later popularized in wartime and espionage efforts and famously associated with the Enigma Machine, a World War II encryption device that was used by the Germans to encode secret messages. Today, encryption is critical in safeguarding sensitive data, especially as organizations transition to the cloud or employ hybrid cloud environments. This shift often leads to data complexity, including data sprawl and expanding attack surfaces. As a result of this data complexity, data breaches can become more costly and more frequent. According to the Cost of a Data Breach report, the global average cost to remediate a data breach in 2025 was USD 4.44 million. With encryption, organizations can deter or mitigate the severity of data breaches. This is achieved by ensuring that hackers can’t access their most sensitive data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information (PII). Organizations, particularly those in healthcare and financial services, also use encryption to meet compliance standards. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates that merchants encrypt the customer payment card data they handle. Similarly, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) highlights encryption as a critical measure for safeguarding personal data against unauthorized access or disclosure. Still, it's not just organizations demanding encryption. Users increasingly seek the peace of mind encryption brings. Signal, a messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption, reported a jump from 12 million to 40 million users in 2022 amid concerns over WhatsApp's privacy policies and data-sharing practices. In recent years, modern encryption algorithms have largely replaced outdated standards like the Data Encryption Standard (DES). New algorithms not only mask data but also support key information security principles such as integrity, authentication and nonrepudiation. Integrity ensures that unauthorized parties do not tamper with data, authentication verifies data origins and nonrepudiation prevents users from denying legitimate activity. Current trends in encryption focus on enhancing encryption algorithms and protocols to keep pace with evolving cyberthreats and technologies. Quantum encryption uses principles of quantum mechanics to create cryptographic keys that are theoretically immune to brute-force attacks. Homomorphic encryption allows organizations to perform computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption. This approach means that organizations can use sensitive data for things like AI model training and analysis without compromising confidentiality or individual privacy. Security Intelligence | 10 December, episode 12 Your weekly news podcast for cybersecurity pros Whether you're a builder, defender, business leader or simply want to stay secure in a connected world, you'll find timely updates and timeless principles in a lively, accessible format. New episodes on Wednesdays at 6am EST. Watch the latest podcast episode Types of data encryption: asymmetric versus symmetric The two main types of encryption are: Symmetric encryption: Encrypts and decrypts data by using a secret symmetric key that is shared by all the parties that are involved in a transaction. Asymmetric encryption (also known as public key encryption and public key cryptography): Encrypts and decrypts data by using two different keys. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt data, but only the holders of the corresponding private key can decrypt that data. Both methods have their strengths and weaknesses. Symmetric encryption is faster and more efficient. However, it also requires meticulous key management because anyone who obtains the symmetric key can decrypt the data. Asymmetric encryption, though slower due to its complexity, offers more robust security by eliminating the need for a secure key exchange. One of the most versatile and well-known solutions for managing asymmetric encryption is a public key infrastructure (PKI). A PKI provides a comprehensive framework for secure communication and authentication, enabling the creation, distribution and validation of public and private key pairs. PKI can help secure various applications, including email, digital signatures and SSL/TLS encryption for web browsing. Organizations generally choose symmetric encryption when speed and efficiency are crucial, such as when encrypting large volumes of data or securing communication within a closed system. When secure communication between parties over insecure channels is essential, such as online transactions, email encryption and digital signatures, organizations might lean on asymmetric encryption. How does data encryption work? Encryption begins by identifying the sensitive information that requires protection. This information can be messages, files, photos, communications or other data. This data exists in plain text format, the original, readable form that needs safeguarding. Encryption algorithms transform this plain text into ciphertext by scrambling the data into an unreadable sequence of characters. This process ensures that only the intended recipient(s) can read the original data. Next, encryption keys are created. An encryption key is like a complex code that is needed to unlock a safe. Without the correct cryptographic key, you cannot access the encrypted data. A longer key size provides higher security by making the decryption process exponentially more complex. In symmetric encryption (see \"Types of data encryption”), a single shared key is used for encryption and decryption. In asymmetric encryption (see \"Types of data encryption”), two keys are created: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. For those without a decryption key, encrypted messages are virtually impossible to decipher. However, users with the decryption key can successfully decrypt the data, essentially reversing the encryption process and converting the ciphertext back into unencrypted, readable plain text. Decryption can also involve an authentication stage, where decrypted data is verified to ensure its integrity and authenticity. This step may include verifying digital signatures, hash functions (see next section) or other forms of authentication to confirm that the data has not been tampered with during transmission. Hash functions Hash functions are closely related to encryption, but these tools address distinct security problems. Hash functions are a type of cryptographic algorithm that is primarily used for data integrity and authentication. They work by taking an input (or message) and producing a fixed-size string of characters, which are known as a hash value or hash code. Their defining feature is their deterministic nature. Given the same input, a hash function will always produce the same output. This process makes them critical for verifying data integrity. Users can compare hash values before and after transmission or storage. If the hash values match, no one has altered the data. While encryption is a reversible process, hash functions are irreversible. It is computationally infeasible to derive the original input data from its hash value alone. For this reason, the primary purpose of hash functions is not to mask sensitive data but to create unique digital fingerprints that cybersecurity professionals can use to verify data integrity and authenticity. Encryption key management Key management is critical for effective data encryption. To understand why, consider the example of a safe. If an individual forgets their code to a safe or it ends up in the wrong hands, they risk losing access to their most valuable possessions or having them stolen. The same logic applies to cryptographic keys. If organizations don't properly manage their keys, they can lose the ability to decrypt and access data or expose themselves to data breaches. For this reason, organizations often prioritize investing in key management systems. These services are critical given that organizations frequently manage a complex network of cryptographic keys and many threat actors know where to look for them. Encryption key management solutions often include features like: A centralized management console for encryption and encryption key policies and configurations Encryption at the file, database and application levels for on-premises and cloud data Role- and group-based access controls and audit logging to help address compliance Automated key lifecycle processes Integration with the latest technologies, such as AI, to improve key management by using analytics and automation Common encryption algorithms Symmetric encryption algorithms Data Encryption Standard (DES): IBM introduced DES in the 1970s as the standard encryption algorithm, a role it held for many years. However, its relatively short key length (56 bits) made it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Eventually, more secure algorithms replaced it. Triple DES (3DES): Developed as an enhancement to DES, 3DES applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block, significantly increasing the key length and strengthening security. Despite its improved security over DES, 3DES is now considered outdated. AES has largely replaced it. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): Often hailed as the gold standard for data encryption, AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that is widely adopted by organizations and governments worldwide, including the US government and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). AES offers strong security with key lengths of 128, 192 or 256 bits. Twofish: Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher that is known for its speed and security. It operates on blocks of data with a block size of 128 bits and supports key lengths of 128, 192 or 256 bits. Since it is open source and resistant to cryptanalysis, organizations often rely on Twofish when security and performance are critical. Asymmetric encryption algorithms RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that is named after its inventors. It relies on the mathematical complexity of prime numbers to generate key pairs. It uses a public-private key pair for encryption and decryption, making it suitable for secure data transmission and digital signatures. RSA frequently helps secure communication protocols such as HTTPS, SSH and TLS. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): ECC is an asymmetric encryption method based on the mathematical properties of elliptic curves over finite fields. It offers robust security with shorter key lengths than other algorithms, which makes it well suited for resource-constrained devices such as smartphones and IoT devices. Benefits of data encryption Encryption can provide various data protection benefits both on premises and in the cloud. Some of the most significant benefits include: Data security Encryption is among the most critical and widespread data security tools. By encoding plain text as ciphertext, encryption helps organizations protect data against a range of cyberattacks, including ransomware and other malware. Notably, the use of infostealer malware that exfiltrates sensitive data is on the rise, according to the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index. Encryption helps combat this threat by making data unusable to hackers, defeating the purpose of stealing it. Recent advances in AI-powered encryption systems have also revolutionized data security practices. These solutions use AI to dynamically adjust encryption parameters based on contextual factors such as network traffic, device type and user behavior. This adaptive approach allows organizations to optimize encryption algorithms in real-time and tailor their data protection strategies to evolving security threats. Cloud security While cloud service providers (CSPs) are responsible for the security of the cloud, customers are responsible for security in the cloud, including the security of any data. Enterprise-wide data encryption can help organizations protect their sensitive data on-premises and in the cloud. Compliance management Many industries and jurisdictions have regulatory requirements and security measures mandating that organizations use encryption to protect sensitive data. Compliance with these regulations helps organizations avoid legal penalties and maintain customer trust. Data integrity Cryptographic tools like hash functions can help detect unauthorized modifications or tampering attempts, which can help ensure the accuracy and integrity of stored and transmitted data. Secure communications Encryption keeps communication channels secure, allowing individuals and organizations to exchange sensitive information, conduct transactions and collaborate with a reduced risk of interception. Protection against insider threats Encryption restricts access to sensitive data to only the users that have the appropriate decryption keys. This measure helps combat insider threats by preventing employees from intentionally or unintentionally accessing, misusing or misplacing sensitive information. For example, even if an employee's company-issued laptop is lost, properly encrypted data on the hard disk remains inaccessible. Potential encryption vulnerabilities Despite its many benefits, encryption is vulnerable to some attacks and misuse. Some common weaknesses of current encryption technologies include: Quantum computing The rise of quantum computing threatens traditional encryption methods. Quantum computers could break some encryption algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, by running powerful quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm. Shor's algorithm can efficiently factor large numbers and solve the discrete logarithm problem, a difficult math problem that many encryption schemes rely on. However, organizations are also using artificial intelligence (AI) to develop quantum-resistant encryption methods. These encryption solutions use AI to anticipate and adapt to potential quantum computing threats before they can break traditional encryption algorithms. Brute-force attacks Brute-force attacks involve hackers systematically trying all possible encryption keys until they discover the correct one. Strong encryption algorithms historically take far too long to break when using brute-force methods. However, advances in computing power risk rendering some encryption methods vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Algorithm vulnerabilities Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in encryption algorithms to decrypt encrypted data. One significant vulnerability is the \"Padding Oracle Attack,\" which involves hackers manipulating padding (extra bits added to plaintext) to reveal plain text data. Side-channel attacks Side channels are unintended pathways for information leakage, such as timing discrepancies and variations in power consumption and electromagnetic emissions. Hackers can use these side channels to gain information about the encryption process and recover encryption keys or plain text data. One example of a side-channel attack might include hiding induction coils on mobile payment systems. This approach would allow attackers to record transactions and extract keys to forge credit cards or make fraudulent charges. Inadequate key management The security of encrypted data generally relies on the secrecy and management of encryption keys. If encryption keys are lost, stolen or compromised, it can lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data. However, AI systems can also help automate key management processes, including key generation, distribution and rotation. This automation improves the efficiency and security of encryption systems, reducing the risk of human error and ensuring that encryption keys are regularly updated and secure. Encryption solutions Encryption is often the first and last defense against hackers and data breaches. Organizations may use different encryption solutions depending on desired security level, data type, regulatory environment and other factors. Some of the most common encryption solutions include: Encryption software: Organizations across industries rely on encryption software to secure data at rest and in transit. This software generally has features and tools that facilitate encryption and decryption operations, including key management and integrations with existing software such as databases, cloud providers and communication platforms. Virtual private networks (VPNs): VPNs encrypt internet traffic to ensure privacy and security. They are essential for securing communication over public networks, especially when employees work remotely or need to access sensitive information outside secure corporate networks. Cloud encryption: Cloud encryption ensures data confidentiality and integrity by encrypting sensitive information before storing it in cloud environments. These solutions protect data in cloud-based applications, platforms and storage services against risks associated with the cloud, including unauthorized access and data exposure. Network encryption: Network encryption encrypts data exchanged between two endpoints over a network to ensure confidentiality and integrity. For example, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, an updated version of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), protects data sent over a browser, such as credit card information sent through an online retail website or login credentials transmitted during online banking sessions. Database encryption: Database encryption encrypts sensitive information stored in databases, such as customer records, financial data and intellectual property, to prevent unauthorized access or theft. Whole disk encryption: Whole disk encryption encrypts entire storage devices to protect data stored on endpoint devices, such as laptops and mobile devices. Hardware-based encryption: Specialized hardware components in devices like encryption chips or modules can provide additional protection for sensitive data, especially when software-based encryption may not suffice. Smartphones, laptops and storage devices often feature hardware-based encryption solutions. File and folder encryption: Individuals and organizations often use file and folder encryption to encrypt sensitive individual files or folders on computers or networks, such as sensitive photos, documents and other digital assets, to prevent unauthorized access. Email encryption: Encrypting email messages and attachments to secure communications channels ensures that sensitive information that is shared via email remains confidential and protected from unauthorized interception and tampering. End-to-end encryption (E2EE): End-to-end encryption is a secure communication process that encrypts data on-device before transferring it to another endpoint to prevent third party tampering. Chat and messaging apps, email services and other communication platforms frequently use E2EE to protect user privacy and confidentiality.

And why aren’t passwords good enough? Before addressing the question ‘what is two-factor authentication’ or ‘what is 2FA,’ let’s consider why it’s important to do everything you can to improve your online account security. With so much of our lives happening on mobile devices and laptops, it’s no wonder our digital accounts have become a magnet for criminals. Malicious attacks against governments, companies, and individuals are more and more common. And there are no signs that the hacks, data breaches, and other forms of cybercrime are slowing down! Luckily, it’s easy for businesses to add an extra level of protection to user accounts in the form of two-factor authentication, also commonly referred to as 2FA. ————————————————————————————————————————————————- ARE YOU A DEVELOPER INTERESTED IN ADDING 2FA TO YOUR APPLICATION? SEE TWILIO APIs & TUTORIALS ————————————————————————————————————————————————- Rise in Cybercrime Requires Stronger Security With 2FA In recent years, we’ve witnessed a massive increase in the number of websites losing personal data of their users. And as cybercrime gets more sophisticated, companies find their old security systems are no match for modern threats and attacks. Sometimes it’s simple human error that has left them exposed. And it’s not just user trust that can be damaged. All types of organizations—global companies, small businesses, start-ups, and even non-profits—can suffer severe financial and reputational loss. For consumers, the after-effects of targeted hack or identity theft can be devastating. Stolen credentials are used to secure fake credit cards and fund shopping sprees, which can damage a victim’s credit rating. And entire bank and cryptocurrency accounts can be drained overnight. A recent study revealed that in 2016 over $16 billion was taken from 15.4 million U.S. consumers. Even more incredible, identify thieves stole over $107 billion in the past six years alone. Clearly, online sites and apps must offer tighter security. And, whenever possible, consumers should get in the habit of protecting themselves with something that’s stronger than just a password. For many, that extra level of security is two-factor authentication. Passwords: Historically Bad But Still In Use How and when did passwords get so vulnerable? Back in 1961, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). To make sure everyone had an equal chance to use the computer, MIT required all students to log in with a secure password. Soon enough, students figured out that they could hack the system, print out the passwords, and hog more computer time. Despite this, and the fact that there are much more secure alternatives, usernames and passwords remain the most common form of user authentication. The general rule of thumb is that a password should be something only you know while being difficult for anyone else to guess. And while using passwords is better than having no protection at all, they’re not foolproof. Here’s why: Humans have lousy memories. A recent report looked at over 1.4 billion stolen passwords and found that most were embarrassingly simple. Among the worst are “111111,” “123456,” “123456789,” “qwerty,” and “password.” While these are easy to remember, any decent hacker could crack these simple passwords in no time.Too many accounts: As users get more comfortable with doing everything online, they open more and more accounts. This eventually creates too many passwords to remember and paves the way for a dangerous habit: password recycling. Here’s why hackers love this trend: it takes just seconds for hacking software to test thousands of stolen sign-in credentials against popular online banks and shopping sites. If a username and password pair is recycled, it’s extremely likely it’ll unlock plenty of other lucrative accounts.Security fatigue sets in: To protect themselves, some consumers try to make it harder for attackers by creating more complex passwords and passphrases. But with so many data breaches flooding the dark web with user information, many just give up and fall back to using weak passwords across multiple accounts. 2FA To The Rescue 2FA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide another piece of information. This second factor could come from one of the following categories: Something you know: This could be a personal identification number (PIN), a password, answers to “secret questions” or a specific keystroke patternSomething you have: Typically, a user would have something in their possession, like a credit card, a smartphone, or a small hardware tokenSomething you are: This category is a little more advanced, and might include biometric pattern of a fingerprint, an iris scan, or a voice print With 2FA, a potential compromise of just one of these factors won’t unlock the account. So, even if your password is stolen or your phone is lost, the chances of a someone else having your second-factor information is highly unlikely. Looking at it from another angle, if a consumer uses 2FA correctly, websites and apps can be more confident of the user’s identity, and unlock the account. Common Types of 2FA If a site you use only requires a password to get in and doesn’t offer 2FA, there’s a good chance that it will be eventually be hacked. That doesn’t mean that all 2FA is the same. Several types of two-factor authentication are in use today; some may be stronger or more complex than others, but all offer better protection than passwords alone. Let’s look at the most common forms of 2FA. Hardware Tokens for 2FA Probably the oldest form of 2FA, hardware tokens are small, like a key fob, and produce a new numeric code every 30-seconds. When a user tries to access an account, they glance at the device and enter the displayed 2FA code back into the site or app. Other versions of hardware tokens automatically transfer the 2FA code when plugged into a computer’s USB port. They’ve got several downsides, however. For businesses, distributing these units is costly. And users find their size makes them easy to lose or misplace. Most importantly, they are not entirely safe from being hacked. SMS Text-Message and Voice-based 2FA SMS-based 2FA interacts directly with a user’s phone. After receiving a username and password, the site sends the user a unique one-time passcode (OTP) via text message. Like the hardware token process, a user must then enter the OTP back into the application before getting access. Similarly, voice-based 2FA automatically dials a user and verbally delivers the 2FA code. While not common, it’s still used in countries where smartphones are expensive, or where cell service is poor. For a low-risk online activity, authentication by text or voice may be all you need. But for websites that store your personal information — like utility companies, banks, or email accounts — this level of 2FA may not be secure enough. In fact, SMS is considered to be the least secure way to authenticate users. Because of this, many companies are upgrading their security by moving beyond SMS-based 2FA. Software Tokens for 2FA The most popular form of two-factor authentication (and a preferred alternative to SMS and voice) uses a software-generated time-based, one-time passcode (also called TOTP, or “soft-token”). First, a user must download and install a free 2FA app on their smartphone or desktop. They can then use the app with any site that supports this type of authentication. At sign-in, the user first enters a username and password, and then, when prompted, they enter the code shown on the app. Like hardware tokens, the soft-token is typically valid for less than a minute. And because the code is generated and displayed on the same device, soft-tokens remove the chance of hacker interception. That’s a big concern with SMS or voice delivery methods. Best of all, since app-based 2FA solutions are available for mobile, wearables, or desktop platforms — and even work offline — user authentication is possible just about everywhere. Push Notification for 2FA Rather than relying on the receipt and entry of a 2FA token, websites and apps can now send the user a push notification that an authentication attempt is taking place. The device owner simply views the details and can approve or deny access with a single touch. It’s passwordless authentication with no codes to enter, and no additional interaction required. By having a direct and secure connection between the retailer, the 2FA service, and the device, push notification eliminates any opportunity for phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or unauthorized access. But it only works with an internet-connected device, one that’s able to install apps to. Also, in areas where smartphone penetration is low, or where the internet is unreliable, SMS-based 2FA may be a preferred fall-back. But where it is an option, push notifications provide a more user-friendly, more secure form of security. Other Forms of Two-Factor Authentication Biometric 2FA, authentication that treats the user as the token, is just around the corner. Recent innovations include verifying a person’s identity via fingerprints, retina patterns, and facial recognition. Ambient noise, pulse, typing patterns, and vocal prints are also being explored. It’s only a matter of time before one of these 2FA methods takes off…and for biometric hackers to figure out how to exploit them. Everybody Should 2FA According to a recent report, stolen, reused, and weak passwords remain a leading cause of security breaches. Unfortunately, passwords are still the main (or only) way many companies protect their users. The good news is that cybercrime is in the news so much that 2FA awareness is quickly growing and usres are demanding that the companies they do business with have improved security. We agree: “Everybody Should 2FA”. Want To Learn More About 2FA? Consumers: Don’t know if your favorite sites or apps have 2FA? Visit TwoFactorAuth.org to find out.

If they don’t, ask them why not. It’s your information they’re putting at risk! Deandre Didn’t Use MFA and Lost Control of His Accounts Deandre learned many of his friends were having problems with online scammers hacking into their social media accounts or receiving phishing messages through email. He thought it was strange but didn’t worry too much about it. Deandre felt like he was probably safe. He didn’t have that many followers. Who’d want to hack him? But one day, all of that would change. Deandre started his morning off as usual, grabbed a cup of coffee and went to sign into his email. Except, he wasn’t able to log in; his email account had been taken over. He then received text messages from family members asking if he was really the one posting weird messages on social media. Scammers were posing as him online and posting to his social pages. He checked it out and was embarrassed by the fake posts. Deandre soon discovered somebody had hacked into more accounts and changed the passwords. This included his bank account and retail apps. The scammers made unauthorized purchases and transactions. Deandre was shocked that in just a quick amount of time, he had lost control of all his important data and finances. He later discovered that since his accounts were linked, scammers gaining access to one entry point, his email, allowed access to other accounts. Deandre wished he had practiced more caution and used MFA on his email account. That could have stopped them from hacking his email, and he could have avoided the whole chain of events. He had to work long hours to recover what was possible and create a new email account. Deandre now always uses MFA and is reassured that his account is significantly more secure—he’ll be the only one controlling it in the future.

This is important because it prevents cybercriminals from stealing, destroying, or accessing your internal data records for their own use. The advantages of 2FA are endless. For example, with 2FA, there’s no need for users to carry or download a token generator, or an app associated with one. Most websites use your mobile device to text, call, or use a personalized 2FA for their business to verify your identity. Some other advantages of 2FA include: • There’s no need to use a hardware token generator. These types of 2FA methods are often lost or misplaced. However, with advanced technology, 2FA methods are more convenient than ever. • Passcode generators are more efficient than traditional passwords. Generators are the safer option because no two passcodes are the same. • Max passcode entry prevents cybercriminals from hacking and accessing sensitive data. • The process is manageable and user-friendly. Authentication methods for 2FA There are different authentication methods when using two-factor authentication. Here’s a list of some of the most popular options. Hardware tokens Businesses can give their employees hardware tokens in the form of a key fob that produces codes every few seconds to a minute. This is one of the oldest forms of two-factor authentication. Push notifications Push two-factor authentication methods require no password. This type of 2FA sends a signal to your phone to either approve/deny or accept/decline access to a website or app to verify your identity. SMS verification SMS, or text messaging, can be used as a form of two-factor authentication when a message is sent to a trusted phone number. The user is prompted to either interact with the text or use a one-time code to verify their identity on a site or app. Voice-based authentication Voice authentication works in a similar way to push notifications, except that your identity is confirmed through automation. The voice will ask you to press a key or state your name to identify yourself. 2FA implementation Implementing 2FA within a business or personal setting is beneficial in protecting vulnerable networks and databases. With a mobile device, you can generate your own codes, or tokens, to provide a unique set of letters/numbers to verify your identity. These codes are sent via SMS and are verified through a website or app. It is important to note that the website or app that you’re identifying yourself through is reliable and safe. One-time passcodes that are generated through apps or websites are more time-sensitive than an SMS code or token. Here are some tips to ensure your two-factor authentication implementation goes as smoothly as possible. • Consider using the most common method of implementation, SMS authentication. It’s convenient and ensures that all user identities are verified via a reliable phone number. • Remember that most users can implement 2FA through the security settings of their smartphone or electronic device. • Find the right two-factor authentication provider. Each company that hosts authentication services has their own process of implementation. For example, the Authenticator app allows you to register one or more of your business/personal devices to ensure that all are protected. Businesses and individuals can implement these two forms of 2FA through Microsoft’s Authenticator app. This service provides authenticator options, both two-factor and multi-factor, depending on your unique individual or business needs. Learn more about 2FA safety. 2FA vs. MFA The difference between two-factor authentication, 2FA, and multi-factor authentication, MFA, is that 2FA, or two-factor authentication, involves two sets of steps to identify a user. In addition, 2FA utilizes one-time passcodes that are time-sensitive to prevent identity theft. On the other hand, MFA, or multi-factor authentication, involves two or more steps or processes to identify a user. Usually, businesses with high-level security (i.e., healthcare facilities, government agencies, or financial services) opt for multi-factor authentication versus two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication helps add a layer of security to all your online personal and business accounts. Learn more about 2FA and MFA services.

Learn more Frequently asked questions Expand all | Collapse all Who should use 2FA? Any organization or individual interested in protecting their personal and business data should utilize 2FA methods. This type of security will ensure that all assets cannot be accessed without proper identity verification. Plus, this can eliminate the possibility of information being exposed to the public by cybercriminals and hackers. How does 2FA protect businesses? 2FA protects businesses by ensuring that all assets (i.e., documents, confidential information, employee personal records) are protected by this dual security system. Unfortunately, with the rise of cyberattacks, traditional passwords are not as secure as they once were. How is Zero Trust and 2FA related? Zero Trust and 2FA both give consumers control over their personal and business-related information. Cybercriminals find new ways to gain access to networks every day. Zero Trust is a business software that helps prevent cybercriminals from getting access to sensitive data and networks by placing a firm protection on business and personal assets. Similarly, 2FA helps safeguard sensitive data and networks, but in a different way—through time-sensitive passcodes, voice messages, and SMS texts and tokens. How effective is 2FA? 2FA is an effective way to ensure that an organization or individual doesn’t fall victim to a cyberattack or hacker. 2FA utilizes time-sensitive token generators, or passcodes, to help prevent identity theft and data loss.

Learn more Home / Identity and Access Management 101 / What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and How Does it Work? What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and How Does it Work? What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)? Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or a VPN. MFA is a core component of a strong identity and access management (IAM) policy. Rather than just asking for a username and password, MFA requires one or more additional verification factors, which decreases the likelihood of a successful cyber attack. Why is MFA Important? The main benefit of MFA is it will enhance your organization's security by requiring your users to identify themselves by more than a username and password. While important, usernames and passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks and can be stolen by third parties. Enforcing the use of an MFA factor like a thumbprint or physical hardware key means increased confidence that your organization will stay safe from cyber criminals. How Does MFA work? MFA works by requiring additional verification information (factors). One of the most common MFA factors that users encounter are one-time passwords (OTP). OTPs are those 4-8 digit codes that you often receive via email, SMS or some sort of mobile app. With OTPs a new code is generated periodically or each time an authentication request is submitted. The code is generated based upon a seed value that is assigned to the user when they first register and some other factor which could simply be a counter that is incremented or a time value.

Download E-Book Previous Next Three Main Types of MFA Authentication Methods Most MFA authentication methodology is based on one of three types of additional information:Things you know (knowledge), such as a password or PINThings you have (possession), such as a badge or smartphoneThings you are (inherence), such as a biometric like fingerprints or voice recognition MFA Examples Examples of Multi-Factor Authentication include using a combination of these elements to authenticate:KnowledgeAnswers to personal security questionsPasswordOTPs (Can be both Knowledge and Possession - You know the OTP and you have to have something in your Possession to get it like your phone)PossessionOTPs generated by smartphone appsOTPs sent via text or emailAccess badges, USB devices, Smart Cards or fobs or security keysSoftware tokens and certificatesInherenceFingerprints, facial recognition, voice, retina or iris scanning or other BiometricsBehavioral analysis Other Types of Multi-Factor Authentication As MFA integrates machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), authentication methods become more sophisticated, including:Location-basedLocation-based MFA usually looks at a user’s IP address and, if possible, their geo location. This information can be used to simply block a user’s access if their location information does not match what is specified on a Allow List or it might be used as an additional form of authentication in addition to other factors such as a password or OTP to confirm that user’s identity.Adaptive Authentication or Risk-based AuthenticationAnother subset of MFA is Adaptive Authentication also referred to as Risk-based Authentication. Adaptive Authentication analyzes additional factors by considering context and behavior when authenticating and often uses these values to assign a level of risk associated with the login attempt. For example:From where is the user when trying to access information?When you are trying to access company information? During your normal hours or during \"off hours\"?What kind of device is used? Is it the same one used yesterday?Is the connection via private network or a public network? The risk level is calculated based upon how these questions are answered and can be used to determine whether or not a user will be prompted for an additional authentication factor or whether or not they will even be allowed to log in. Thus another term used to describe this type of authentication is risk-based authentication.With Adaptive Authentication in place, a user logging in from a cafe late at night, an activity they do not normally do, might be required to enter a code texted to the user’s phone in addition to providing their username and password. Whereas, when they log in from the office every day at 9 am they are simply prompted to provide their username and password.Cyber criminals spend their lives trying to steal your information and an effective and enforced MFA strategy is your first line of defense against them. An effective data security plan will save your organization time and money in the future. What's the Difference between MFA and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)? MFA is often used interchangeably with two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA is basically a subset of MFA since 2FA restricts the number of factors that are required to only two factors, while MFA can be two or more. What is MFA in Cloud Computing With the advent of Cloud Computing, MFA has become even more necessary. As companies move their systems to the cloud they can no longer rely upon a user being physically on the same network as a system as a security factor. Additional security needs to be put into place to ensure that those accessing the systems are not bad actors. As users are accessing these systems anytime and from anyplace MFA can help ensure that they are who they say they are by prompting for additional authentication factors that are more difficult for hackers to imitate or use brute force methods to crack. MFA for Office 365 Many cloud based systems provide their own MFA offerings like AWS or Microsoft’s Office 365 product. Office 365 by default uses Azure Active Directory (AD) as its authentication system. And there are a few limitations. For example, you only have four basic options when it comes to what type of additional authentication factor they can use: Microsoft Authenticator, SMS, Voice and Oauth Token. You also might have to spend more on licensing depending on the types of options you want available and whether or not you want to control exactly which users will need to use MFA.Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solutions like OneLogin offer many more MFA authentication methods when it comes to strong authentication factors and they integrate more easily with applications outside of the Microsoft ecosystem.

Cloud security is a collection of procedures and technology designed to address external and internal threats to business security. Organizations need cloud security as they move toward their digital transformation strategy and incorporate cloud-based tools and services as part of their infrastructure. The terms digital transformation and cloud migration have been used regularly in enterprise settings over recent years. While both phrases can mean different things to different organizations, each is driven by a common denominator: the need for change. As enterprises embrace these concepts and move toward optimizing their operational approach, new challenges arise when balancing productivity levels and security. While more modern technologies help organizations advance capabilities outside the confines of on-premises infrastructure, transitioning primarily to cloud-based environments can have several implications if not done securely. Striking the right balance requires an understanding of how modern-day enterprises can benefit from the use of interconnected cloud technologies while deploying the best cloud security practices.

The \"cloud\" or more specifically, \"cloud computing\" refers to the process of accessing resources, software and databases over the internet and outside the confines of local hardware restrictions. This technology gives organizations flexibility when scaling their operations by offloading a portion, or majority, of their infrastructure management to third-party hosting providers. The most common and widely adopted cloud computing services are: Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offers a hybrid approach, which allows organizations to manage some of their data and applications on-premises. At the same time, it relies on cloud providers to manage servers, hardware, networking, virtualization and storage needs. Platform as a service (PaaS) gives organizations the ability to streamline their application development and delivery. It does so by providing a custom application framework that automatically manages operating systems, software updates, storage and supporting infrastructure in the cloud. Software as a service (SaaS) provides cloud-based software hosted online and typically available on a subscription basis. Third-party providers manage all potential technical issues, such as data, middleware, servers and storage. This setup helps minimize IT resource expenditures and streamline maintenance and support functions.

New episodes on Wednesdays at 6am EST. Watch the latest podcast episode Why is cloud security important? In modern-day enterprises, there has been a growing transition to cloud-based environments and IaaS, PaaS or SaaS computing models. The dynamic nature of infrastructure management, especially in scaling applications and services, can bring several challenges to enterprises when adequately resourcing their departments. These as-a-service models give organizations the ability to offload many of the time-consuming, IT-related tasks. As companies continue to migrate to the cloud, understanding the security requirements for keeping data safe has become critical. While third-party cloud computing providers can take on the management of this infrastructure, the responsibility of data asset security and accountability doesn't necessarily shift along with it. By default, most cloud providers follow best security practices and take active steps to protect the integrity of their servers. However, organizations need to make their own considerations when protecting data, applications and workloads running on the cloud. Security threats have become more advanced as the digital landscape continues to evolve. These threats explicitly target cloud computing providers due to an organization's overall lack of visibility in data access and movement. Without taking active steps to improve their cloud security, organizations can face significant governance and compliance risks when managing client information, regardless of where it is stored. Cloud security should be an important topic of discussion regardless of the size of your enterprise. Cloud infrastructure supports nearly all aspects of modern computing in all industries and across multiple verticals. However, successful cloud adoption depends on putting in place adequate countermeasures to defend against modern-day cyberattacks. Regardless of whether your organization operates in a public, private or hybrid cloud environment, cloud security solutions and best practices are a necessity for maintaining business continuity. What are some cloud security challenges? Lack of visibility It's easy to lose track of how your data is accessed and by whom because many cloud services are accessed outside of corporate networks and through third parties. Multitenancy Public cloud environments house multiple client infrastructures under the same umbrella. As a result, it's possible that your hosted services can get compromised by malicious attackers as collateral damage when targeting other businesses. Access management and shadow IT While enterprises may be able to successfully manage and restrict access points across on-premises systems, administering these same levels of restrictions can be challenging in cloud environments. This can be dangerous for organizations that don't deploy bring-your-own device (BYOD) policies and allow unfiltered access to cloud services from any device or geolocation. Compliance Regulatory compliance management is oftentimes a source of confusion for enterprises that use public or hybrid cloud deployments. Overall accountability for data privacy and security still rests with the enterprise, and heavy reliance on third-party solutions to manage this component can lead to costly compliance issues. Misconfigurations A substantial portion of breached records can be attributed to misconfigured assets, making the inadvertent insider a key issue for cloud computing environments. Misconfigurations can include leaving default administrative passwords in place, or not creating appropriate privacy settings. What types of cloud security solutions are available? Identity and access management (IAM) Identity and access management (IAM) tools and services allow enterprises to deploy policy-driven enforcement protocols for all users attempting to access both on-premises and cloud-based services. The core functionality of IAM is to create digital identities for all users so they can be actively monitored and restricted when necessary during all data interactions. Data loss prevention (DLP) Data loss prevention (DLP) services offer a set of tools and services designed to ensure the security of regulated cloud data. DLP solutions use a combination of remediation alerts, data encryption and other preventive measures to protect all stored data, whether at rest or in motion. Security information and event management (SIEM) Security information and event management (SIEM) provides a comprehensive security orchestration solution that automates threat monitoring, detection and response in cloud-based environments. SIEM technology uses artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies to correlate log data across multiple platforms and digital assets. This gives IT teams the ability to successfully apply their network security protocols, enabling them to quickly react to any potential threats. Business continuity and disaster recovery Regardless of the preventive measures organizations have in place for their on-premises and cloud-based infrastructures, data breaches and disruptive outages can still occur. Enterprises must be able to quickly react to newly discovered vulnerabilities or significant system outages as soon as possible. Disaster recovery solutions are a staple in cloud security and provide organizations with the tools, services and protocols necessary to expedite the recovery of lost data and resume normal business operations. How should you approach cloud security? The way to approach cloud security is different for every organization and can depend on several variables. However, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has made a list of best practices that can be followed to establish a secure and sustainable cloud computing framework. The NIST has created necessary steps for every organization to self-assess their security preparedness and apply adequate preventive and recovery security measures to their systems. These principles are built on the NIST's five pillars of a cybersecurity framework: Identify, protect, detect, respond and recover. Another emerging technology in cloud security that supports the execution of NIST's cybersecurity framework is cloud security posture management (CSPM). CSPM solutions are designed to address a common flaw in many cloud environments, misconfigurations. Cloud infrastructures that remain misconfigured by enterprises or even cloud providers can lead to several vulnerabilities that significantly increase an organization's attack surface. CSPM addresses these issues by helping to organize and deploy the core components of cloud security. These include identity and access management (IAM), regulatory compliance management, traffic monitoring, threat response, risk mitigation and digital asset management.

Cloud security offers deep insights into sensitive data locations, access patterns, and potential exposure risks for better management. Types of cloud environments What are the different types of cloud environments? There are different types of cloud environments that meet different business needs. These include public, private, hybrid, and multicloud environments. Public cloud. A public cloud is a cloud infrastructure that’s owned and managed by a third-party provider. It delivers services such as compute, storage, and applications over the internet. Resources are shared among multiple customers, a feature that’s also known as multitenancy. Public clouds are suitable for hosting websites, application development and testing, and storage of non-sensitive data. A public cloud offers: Scalability. Businesses can quickly scale resources up or down. Cost efficiency. Providers offer pay-as-you-go pricing with no need for upfront investments in hardware. Ease of use. Minimal management is required. Private cloud. A private cloud is a cloud environment dedicated to a single organization, which gets sole use of resources. It might be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. Private clouds are appropriate for organizations with specific performance, compliance, or security needs, such as organizations in healthcare, finance, or government. Private clouds offer: Increased control. Organizations have greater oversight of data, applications, and infrastructure. Customizable security. Security is tailored to meet specific compliance or regulatory needs. Resource isolation. Resources aren't shared with other organizations. Hybrid cloud. A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, and it allows data and applications to move seamlessly between them. This approach provides flexibility to optimize costs and performance. Hybrid clouds are ideal for businesses with variable workloads, disaster recovery needs, or phased migration to the cloud. Hybrid cloud provides: Workload flexibility. An organization can use private cloud for sensitive tasks and public cloud for scalability. Cost optimization. Scale workloads economically by using public cloud resources when needed. Multicloud. Multicloud refers to the use of multiple cloud services from different providers to meet specific requirements, avoid vendor lock-in, or increase redundancy. It’s often used by large enterprises seeking specialized capabilities, improved performance, or robust disaster recovery. However, this approach introduces greater management complexity, as it involves coordinating diverse tools, platforms, and policies. A multicloud approach delivers: Provider flexibility. Businesses choose the best cloud service for each task. Risk mitigation. By reducing dependency on a single provider, organizations enhance resilience and mitigate risk. Importance Why is cloud security important? Cloud security is crucial for protecting sensitive data and applications hosted in cloud environments. As businesses increasingly rely on the cloud for storage, processing, and collaboration, they face risks like unauthorized access, data breaches, data leaks, and cyberattacks. Effective cloud security includes measures such as encryption, access controls, and real-time threat detection and response to help safeguard sensitive information and maintain the integrity of critical applications. End-to-end solutions that protect multicloud environments are also essential. Generative AI is becoming an important tool in cloud security. Generative AI detects and respond to threats in real time, minimizing the risk of data breaches. It also enhances threat intelligence by analyzing vast amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies that traditional security measures might miss. Robust cloud security helps businesses improve visibility into their environments and avoid or quickly recover from disruptions, helping to minimize downtime and maintain continuous access to critical systems and data. This resilience is essential for maintaining trust with customers and sustaining long-term success. How it works How does cloud security work? Cloud security is guided by bringing security in earlier, taking a proactive approach to continuously reduce risks, and remediating faster with unified security. Cloud security relies on a suite of tools and technologies designed to safeguard resources. These include firewalls for network protection, encryption to secure data in transit and at rest, and identity and access management (IAM) systems to control user permissions. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) monitor cloud environments for suspicious activity, while endpoint security checks to make sure that devices accessing the cloud are secure. Another approach involves a generative AI-powered cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP). A CNAPP acts as a single command center where multiple cloud security solutions are consolidated under one umbrella. These include cloud security posture management (CSPM), multipipeline DevOps security, cloud workload protection platforms (CWPPs), cloud detection and response (CDR), cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and cloud service network security (CSNS). A CNAPP detects and mitigates vulnerabilities across the entire software lifecycle, providing robust security against evolving threats. CNAPPs use generative AI to provide real-time insights, automated threat detection, and proactive risk management, reducing the attack surface and enhancing resilience in dynamic cloud-native environments. Clear policies and procedures are needed for cloud security. Organizations must establish rules for data access, storage, and sharing, so that employees and partners follow best practices. Regular security assessments and audits identify vulnerabilities, while incident response plans support swift action during breaches. Policies also include compliance measures to meet legal and regulatory standards, as well as procedures for regular backups to help with data recovery in the event of an attack or failure. Cloud security is built on a shared responsibility model, which divides security duties between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the customer. The CSP is typically responsible for securing the infrastructure, including hardware, networking, and physical data centers. Customers, on the other hand, are responsible for securing their own data, applications, and user access. For example, in a software as a service (SaaS) environment, the provider secures the application itself, but the customer must manage user permissions and secure their data within the application. This collaborative approach allows both parties to contribute to a robust security posture. By integrating advanced technologies, implementing comprehensive policies, and adhering to the shared responsibility model, cloud security creates a resilient environment that protects against modern cyberthreats. Risks and threats Common risks and threats in cloud security While offering scalability and flexibility, hybrid and multicloud environments also introduce security risks and threats. Here are some common challenges: Expanded attack surface. More cloud-native development means that data, apps, and infrastructure are increasingly distributed—which creates more entry points for attackers to exploit. New attack surfaces resulting from generative AI. While it can dramatically increase productivity, generative AI also has the potential to introduce security risks, including accidental data exposure. People uploading sensitive information to train generative AI models might inadvertently expose critical data. Data breaches and leaks. Cloud storage and databases are common targets for attackers. Misconfigurations, such as leaving sensitive data in public-facing buckets, weak encryption, or compromised credentials, might lead to data breaches or accidental leaks. Evolving compliance regulations. Failure to comply with evolving regulations can bring hefty fines, legal penalties, and loss of customer trust. Multicloud environments increase complexity with shared responsibility models and varying security standards across CSPs. Cloud configuration errors. Misconfigurations in cloud services—due to improper access controls or lack of expertise or oversight—can lead to data breaches and compliance violations. Examples of configuration errors include unsecured storage buckets, overly permissive IAM policies, or exposed management consoles. Insider threats. Insider threats—whether malicious or accidental—pose significant risks. Employees, contractors, or partners with privileged access to cloud environments might intentionally or inadvertently expose sensitive data, misconfigure settings, or introduce vulnerabilities. Tools and technologies Useful tools and technologies for cloud security Cloud security requires a range of specialized tools and technologies to address threats across diverse environments. Here’s an overview: Cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP). CNAPP is a unified framework that integrates multiple security components to provide comprehensive protection across cloud-native environments, from development to runtime. CNAPP includes:  Cloud security posture management (CSPM) to identify and remediate misconfigurations, compliance issues, and risks in cloud infrastructure to maintain secure environments. Infrastructure as code security that supports secure configurations in templates by detecting vulnerabilities and enforcing policies before deployment. Data security posture management (DSPM), which focuses on discovering, classifying, and securing sensitive data across cloud environments to prevent unauthorized access and leaks. DevOps security with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline hardening to secure the software development lifecycle by integrating security checks into CI/CD pipelines, including dependency scanning and runtime vulnerability assessments for vulnerability management. AI-powered security posture management (AI-SPM) that leverages AI to predict, detect, and respond to threats in real time, providing advanced risk insights and automated remediation. Cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) and exposure management to manage and restrict excessive permissions in cloud environments, reducing the attack surface by only granting least-privilege access. Security information and event management (SIEM). SIEM aggregates, analyzes, and correlates logs and security events from multiple sources to provide real-time monitoring, incident detection, and compliance reporting. Extended detection and response (XDR). XDR unifies threat detection, response, and remediation across endpoints, networks, and cloud environments, enabling a holistic view of attacks and faster response times. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs). IDPSs monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activity, identifying potential intrusions or policy violations. Prevention mechanisms block detected threats in real time. Endpoint protection platforms (EPPs). EPPs secure devices connected to cloud environments by protecting against malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access. Advanced platforms include behavioral analysis and machine learning for enhanced protection. Data loss prevention (DLP). DLP tools prevent sensitive data from being accessed, shared, or transmitted in unauthorized ways. They enforce policies on data at rest, in motion, or in use, supporting compliance and mitigating breaches. Endpoint detection and response (EDR). EDR is a security solution that monitors and analyzes endpoint activity in real time to detect, investigate, and respond to threats such as malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access. Security exposure management (SEM). SEM enriches asset information with security context that helps proactively manage attack surfaces, protect critical assets, and explore and mitigate exposure risk. Compliance Compliance and regulatory considerations Organizations using cloud environments must adhere to various compliance and regulatory standards to protect data security, privacy, and integrity. A few key frameworks include: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European Union law to protect personal data and privacy. It mandates organizations to implement robust security measures, respect individuals' rights to privacy, and notify authorities within 72 hours of a data breach. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which governs the protection of sensitive health information in the US. Organizations handling protected health information must implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to provide confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access. ISO/IEC 27001, which is an international standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an information security management system. It emphasizes a risk-based approach to managing security, requiring organizations to identify vulnerabilities, enforce controls, and undergo regular audits. The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, which provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks through five core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. It’s widely used to align organizational security practices with industry standards and enhance overall resilience against cyberthreats. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a nonprofit whose mission is to identify, develop, validate, promote, and sustain best practice solutions for cyberdefense. It draws on the expertise of cybersecurity and IT professionals from government, business, and academia from around the world. Trends What are current and emerging trends in cloud security? Cloud security continues to evolve to address increasingly sophisticated threats, driven by technological advancements and the growing complexity of cloud environments. A few current and emerging trends include: Securing modern AI applications. As organizations rapidly adopt generative AI technology, they must properly secure these applications against threats such as supply chain attacks, prompt injections, and data breaches. Zero Trust architecture. This approach enforces strict access controls by verifying every employee and device and restricting implicit trust within or outside the network. “Shift-left” approach. Shift-left integrates security early in the development lifecycle, so vulnerabilities are identified and addressed before deployment. By incorporating automated security testing and compliance checks in the CI/CD pipeline, organizations reduce risks, enhance code quality, and accelerate secure software delivery. Serverless security. Serverless computing, which involves the cloud provider managing the infrastructure and servers, introduces unique security challenges due to its highly dynamic nature and reliance on third-party services. Serverless security is needed to protect ephemeral workloads, API endpoints, and the underlying cloud platform. Quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions. Quantum computing poses potential risks to traditional encryption algorithms, prompting the need for quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions in cloud environments. Container security. Container security includes protecting containers and orchestration platforms. To safeguard containerized workloads, organizations need tools that detect malicious activities, even during runtime, while providing visibility into container-related events and decommissioning rogue containers. Continuous threat exposure management (CTEM). CTEM helps organizations proactively identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities before they are exploited. By continuously evaluating security risks across cloud environments, CTEM supports a dynamic defense strategy that adapts to evolving threats and minimizes potential attack surfaces. Solutions Choosing a cloud security solution Because businesses are increasingly relying on hybrid and multicloud environments, it’s important to implement comprehensive cloud security tools and processes. Effective cloud security not only helps reduce risks and maintain regulatory compliance, it also improves operational resilience, fosters innovation, and builds trust with customers.

Cloud security refers to the cybersecurity policies, best practices, controls, and technologies used to secure applications, data, and infrastructure in cloud environments. In particular, cloud security works to provide storage and network protection against internal and external threats, access management, data governance and compliance, and disaster recovery.Cloud computing has become the technology of choice for companies looking to gain the agility and flexibility needed to accelerate innovation and meet the expectations of today’s modern consumers. But migrating to more dynamic cloud environments requires new approaches to security to ensure that data remains secure across online infrastructure, applications, and platforms. Learn more about Google Cloud’s security model and how we’re helping solve the toughest security challenges with advanced security products and solutions. Get started for freeCloud security definedCloud security is the set of cybersecurity measures used to protect cloud-based applications, data, and infrastructure. This includes applying security policies, practices, controls, and other technologies like identity and access management and data loss prevention tools to help secure cloud environments against unauthorized access, online attacks, and insider threats. How does cloud security work?Cloud security mainly focuses on how to implement policies, processes, and technologies together so they ensure data protection, support regulatory compliance, and provide control over privacy, access, and authentication for users and devices. Cloud service providers (CSPs) typically follow a shared responsibility model, which means implementing cloud computing security is both the responsibility of the cloud provider and you—the customer. Think of it as a responsibility framework that defines which security tasks belong to the cloud provider and which are the duty of the customer. Understanding where your provider’s security responsibilities end and yours begin is critical for building a resilient cloud security strategy. Broadly speaking, the CSP is always responsible for the cloud and its core infrastructure, while the customer is expected to secure anything that runs “in” the cloud, such as network controls, identity and access management, data, and applications.  Shared responsibility models vary depending on the service provider and the cloud computing service model you use—the more the provider manages, the more they can protect.Here’s a look at how this typically works: Cloud computing service modelYour responsibilityCSP responsibilityInfrastructure as a service (IaaS)You secure your data, applications, virtual network controls, operating system, and user access. The cloud provider secures compute, storage, and physical network, including all patching and configuration.  Platform as a service (PaaS)You secure your data, user access, and applications.The cloud provider secures compute, storage, physical network, virtual network controls, and operating system. Software as a service (SaaS)You are responsible for securing your data and user access. The cloud provider secures compute, storage, physical network, virtual network controls, operating system, applications, and middleware.

The cloud provider secures compute, storage, physical network, virtual network controls, operating system, applications, and middleware. More recently, a new model for cloud computing security is emerging which sees shared responsibility models shifting to shared fate models. Under shared fate, a cloud provider provides more comprehensive guidance, resources, and tools to help customers sustain secure use of the cloud, rather than leaving customers to navigate risk management in cloud-native environments. Why is cloud security important?It’s imperative to rethink security approaches as more companies move to the cloud from on-premises environments, especially with data governance and compliance under the regulatory microscope. In an increasingly hybrid and multicloud world, you have more freedom than ever to build where and when you want. But it also means, security is a lot more complicated than stopping someone from accessing your network. Unfortunately, many organizations tend to treat security as an afterthought and may forgo best practices in favor of chasing after faster digital transformation. As a result, attackers see cloud-based targets as a potentially easy path to big gains and are adapting their tactics to exploit vulnerabilities accordingly. While cloud security can never guarantee complete prevention of attacks and vulnerabilities, a well-designed cloud security strategy can go a long way toward preventing breaches or mitigating damage, improving compliance, and building stronger customer trust.Cloud security risks and challenges Cloud suffers from similar security risks that you might encounter in traditional environments, such as insider threats, data breaches and data loss, phishing, malware, DDoS attacks, and vulnerable APIs.  However, most organizations will likely face specific cloud security challenges, including: Lack of visibilityCloud-based resources run on infrastructure that is located outside your corporate network and owned by a third party. As a result, traditional network visibility tools are not suitable for cloud environments, making it difficult for you to gain oversight into all your cloud assets, how they are being accessed, and who has access to them. MisconfigurationsMisconfigured cloud security settings are one of the leading causes of data breaches in cloud environments. Cloud-based services are made to enable easy access and data sharing, but many organizations may not have a full understanding of how to secure cloud infrastructure. This can lead to misconfigurations, such as leaving default passwords in place, failing to activate data encryption, or mismanaging permission controls. Access managementCloud deployments can be accessed directly using the public internet, which enables convenient access from any location or device. At the same time, it also means that attackers can more easily gain authorized resources with compromised credentials or improper access control.  Dynamic workloadsCloud resources can be provisioned and dynamically scaled up or down based on your workload needs. However, many legacy security tools are unable to enforce policies in flexible environments with constantly changing and ephemeral workloads that can be added or removed in a matter of seconds. ComplianceThe cloud adds another layer of regulatory and internal compliance requirements that you can violate even if you don’t experience a security breach. Managing compliance in the cloud is an overwhelming and continuous process. Unlike an on-premises data center where you have complete control over your data and how it is accessed, it is much harder for companies to consistently identify all cloud assets and controls, map them to relevant requirements, and properly document everything. Benefits of cloud securityAlthough cloud security has often been framed as a barrier to cloud adoption, the reality is that cloud is no more or less secure than on-premises security. In fact, cloud computing security offers many advantages for businesses that can improve your overall security posture.The top cloud providers have secure-by-design infrastructure and layered security that is built directly into the platform and its services, including everything from zero-trust network architecture to identity and access management to multi-factor authentication, encryption, and continuous logging and monitoring. Plus, the cloud helps you to automate and manage security at an enormous scale. Other common cloud security benefits include:Greater visibilityOnly an integrated cloud-based security stack is capable of providing the centralized visibility of cloud resources and data that is vital for defending against breaches and other potential threats. Cloud security can provide the tools, technologies, and processes to log, monitor, and analyze events for understanding exactly what’s happening in your cloud environments.Centralized securityCloud security allows you to consolidate protection of cloud-based networks for streamlined, continuous monitoring and analysis of numerous devices, endpoints, and systems. It also enables you to centrally manage software updates and policies from one place and even implement and action disaster recovery plans. Reduced costsWith cloud security, you don’t have to pay for dedicated hardware to upgrade your security or use valuable resources to handle security updates and configurations. CSPs provide advanced security features that allow for automated protection capabilities with little to no human intervention. Data protectionThe best cloud computing providers will provide data security by design, offering strong access controls, encryption for data at rest and in transit, and data loss prevention (DLP) to secure your cloud data wherever it’s located or managed. Cloud complianceCloud providers go to great lengths to comply with both international and industry compliance standards, often undergoing rigorous independent verifications of their security, privacy, and compliance controls.Advanced threat detectionReputable CSPs also invest in cutting-edge technologies and highly skilled experts to provide real–time global threat intelligence that can detect both known and unknown threats in the wild and in your networks for faster remediation.Types of cloud security solutionsCloud security is constantly evolving and adapting as new security threats emerge. As a result, many different types of cloud security solutions are available on the market today, and the list below is by no means exhaustive.Identity and access management (IAM): IAM services and tools allow administrators to centrally manage and control who has access to specific cloud-based and on-premises resources. IAM can enable you to actively monitor and restrict how users interact with services, allowing you to enforce your policies across your entire organization. Data loss prevention (DLP): DLP can help you gain visibility into the data you store and process by providing capabilities to automatically discover, classify, and de-identify regulated cloud data. Security information and event management (SIEM): SIEM solutions combine security information and security event management to offer automated monitoring, detection, and incident response to threats in your cloud environments. Using AI and ML technologies, SIEM tools allow you to examine and analyze log data generated across your applications and network devices—and act quickly if a potential threat is detected. Public key infrastructure (PKI): PKI is the framework used to manage secure, encrypted information exchange using digital certificates. PKI solutions typically provide authentication services for applications and verify that data remains uncompromised and confidential through transport. Cloud-based PKI services allow organizations to manage and deploy digital certificates used for user, device, and service authentication. Solve your business challenges with Google CloudNew customers get $300 in free credits to spend on Google Cloud.Get startedTalk to a Google Cloud sales specialist to discuss your unique challenge in more detail.

Enhance your cloud security strategy Download the Guide Now In the cloud, security isn’t a luxury — it’s a necessity. Think of cloud security as the silent bodyguard for your digital ecosystem. Unauthorized access, data leaks, and shadow IT are all potential threats lurking in the vast expanse of the cloud. But just as a skilled bodyguard anticipates and neutralizes threats without drawing attention, cloud security continuously defends your assets, identifying vulnerabilities and enforcing controls seamlessly so you can focus on innovation. In today’s rapidly evolving threat landscape, cloud security isn’t just about locking down data; it’s about ensuring resilience, trust, and agility as your organization scales in the cloud. What is cloud security? Cloud security refers to a broad set of strategies and technologies designed to protect data, applications, and infrastructure hosted in the cloud. As more organizations rely on cloud computing to store and manage critical business data, ensuring the security of these environments has become a top priority. Cloud security includes various tools, policies, and controls that safeguard cloud-based systems against unauthorized access, data breaches, and evolving cyber threats. Cloud computing (commonly known as “the cloud”) is the delivery of on-demand computing services — such as servers, storage, databases, and software — over the internet. This enables businesses to scale quickly, reduce IT costs, and enhance flexibility. However, the increased adoption of cloud services introduces new security challenges, such as managing access control and maintaining data privacy across complex multi-cloud or hybrid environments. The primary goals of cloud security include: Protecting Data Privacy: Ensuring that sensitive information remains secure while in transit and at restManaging Multi-Cloud Security: Addressing the unique security challenges posed by the use of multiple cloud service providers (CSPs)Access Control: Restricting access to cloud environments and ensuring that only authorized users, devices, and applications can interact with the cloud​ By implementing robust cloud security measures, organizations can confidently leverage the benefits of cloud computing while minimizing risks and maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulations. Cloud security for different deployment models Cloud computing can be deployed in several ways, each with unique security concerns and best practices. Understanding these deployment models — public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud — is essential for building a robust cloud security strategy. Public cloud The public cloud is owned and operated by third-party CSPs, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. In this model, services and resources are shared among multiple organizations over the internet. Public cloud environments are popular due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness, but they come with unique security challenges: Security Concerns: The shared nature of the public cloud can increase risks, including data breaches and security misconfigurations​. Since the cloud provider manages much of the infrastructure, organizations must focus on securing their data and applications within the public cloud.Best Practices: Use encryption, identity and access management (IAM), and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect sensitive data and ensure only authorized users have access. Private cloud The private cloud is dedicated to a single organization, offering greater control over data, security, and compliance. It can be hosted either on-premises or by a third-party provider but remains isolated from other users. This model is ideal for organizations with strict regulatory requirements, such as those in the healthcare or financial sectors: Security Concerns: Although private clouds provide enhanced security and control, they come with higher costs and require in-depth management to ensure protection from internal threats.Best Practices: Implement strong access controls, regular security audits, and data loss prevention (DLP) technologies to ensure data integrity and compliance with industry standards like HIPAA or PCI DSS. Hybrid cloud A hybrid cloud combines the benefits of both public and private cloud environments, allowing organizations to scale their operations while maintaining security for sensitive workloads. For example, an organization might run customer-facing applications in the public cloud while keeping financial data in a private cloud. Security Concerns: The complexity of managing security across both public and private environments increases the risk of vulnerabilities. Data transfer between these environments also needs to be secured.Best Practices: Use strong encryption for data moving between clouds, integrate security monitoring across both environments, and apply consistent access management policies across all platforms. Multi-cloud A multi-cloud strategy involves using multiple public cloud services from different providers. This approach gives organizations flexibility and reduces the risk of vendor lock-in. However, managing security across different platforms introduces additional challenges: Security Concerns: Managing security policies consistently across multiple cloud platforms can lead to gaps that adversaries may exploit.Best Practices: Implement a unified security management platform that integrates across all cloud providers and continuously monitors for threats. Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) and cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) tools are also useful to maintain consistent policies and visibility. By choosing the right deployment model and applying these best practices, organizations can tailor their cloud security strategies to meet their specific needs, whether they prioritize flexibility, control, or regulatory compliance. Essential cloud security tools To secure cloud environments, organizations rely on a range of tools designed to protect data, manage access, and respond to threats in real time.  A cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) integrates many of these cloud security solutions into one platform. It helps protect cloud-native applications by scanning for vulnerabilities, monitoring cloud workloads, and securing data from code to cloud. Tool Description Use Cases Cloud Workload Protection PlatformsA cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) focuses on securing workloads running in the cloud, such as virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions. CWPPs continuously monitor workloads for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.CWPPs are crucial for companies running complex cloud environments with multiple types of workloads, providing threat detection and vulnerability management.Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement ManagementCIEM helps manage and control who has access to different parts of a cloud environment. It ensures that permissions and access controls are properly configured to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.CIEM is key for reducing over-privileged accounts and preventing potential breaches caused by mismanaged permissions.Cloud Detection and ResponseCloud detection and response (CDR) tools are real-time security solutions that identify and respond to threats within cloud environments. They continuously monitor cloud infrastructure and provide alerts when suspicious activity is detected.CDR helps organizations respond quickly to emerging threats, minimizing potential damage.Cloud Security Posture ManagementCloud security posture management (CSPM) tools automatically assess cloud environments for security risks. They identify misconfigurations, noncompliant resources, and vulnerabilities, helping organizations maintain a strong security posture.CSPM is critical for organizations using multi-cloud environments, ensuring continuous compliance with security standards and preventing misconfigurations.Application Security Posture ManagementApplication security posture management (ASPM) tools ensure that applications deployed in the cloud are secure. They monitor the applications’ configurations, dependencies, and code to identify any vulnerabilities or risks.ASPM is useful for businesses developing and deploying cloud-native applications, ensuring secure development practices.Data Security Posture ManagementData security posture management (DSPM) focuses specifically on managing the security of data within cloud environments. These tools ensure data is encrypted, access is controlled, and sensitive information is protected.DSPM is essential for organizations that handle sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) or financial records.Container SecurityContainer security tools are designed to protect containerized applications, a common cloud-native technology. These tools secure the container's runtime, scan for vulnerabilities, and ensure that containers are not misconfigured​.Organizations using Docker or Kubernetes benefit from container security solutions that protect both development and production environments. By integrating these essential cloud security tools, organizations can safeguard their cloud environments against a wide range of security threats, ensuring compliance and maintaining control over sensitive data​. The Complete Guide to CNAPPs Download CrowdStrike's Complete Guide to CNAPPs to understand why Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms are a critical component of modern cloud security strategies and how to best integrate them to development lifecycles. Download Now Why Zero Trust is critical for cloud security Zero Trust is a security model that assumes that no users or devices are trusted automatically, whether they are inside or outside the network. In cloud environments, where data is spread across multiple platforms, this framework is essential for safeguarding sensitive information. Key Principles of Zero Trust: Continuous Verification: Every access attempt — whether it is from a user, device, or app — is continuously verified to prevent unauthorized access​.Least Privilege Access: Users and devices are only given the minimum permissions needed, reducing security risks.Micro-Segmentation: The cloud is divided into smaller segments, limiting lateral movement if an attacker gains access. In cloud environments, threats can come from anywhere. Zero Trust protects against both insider threats and external attacks by ensuring every action is verified and controlled. This model also prevents hackers from moving freely if they breach one part of the system. Zero Trust is key for securing modern cloud infrastructure, providing continuous protection for data, apps, and users across the cloud​. Understanding the shared responsibility model In cloud security, the shared responsibility model defines how security responsibilities are divided between the CSP and the customer. This model is essential because both parties play a role in ensuring that data and systems are properly secured. How the shared responsibility model works in cloud security The cloud provider is responsible for securing the cloud infrastructure itself, including the hardware, software, and network that runs the cloud services. This involves protecting the physical data centers and the core cloud infrastructure from cyberattacks, ensuring uptime, and maintaining the security of the platform. The customer, on the other hand, is responsible for securing their data, applications, and any configurations within the cloud. This includes tasks like managing identity and access controls, configuring security settings properly, and ensuring compliance with industry standards. For example, while the cloud provider ensures the underlying systems are secure, the customer must ensure that sensitive data is encrypted, access permissions are properly set, and vulnerabilities in applications are addressed. By understanding and implementing the shared responsibility model, organizations can better protect their data and ensure a more secure cloud environment. Expert Tip An example of a shared responsibility failure is when organizations do not properly configure their cloud storage, leaving it exposed to the public. Even though the cloud provider secures the infrastructure, the customer is responsible for configuring the privacy settings. In this scenario, customer misconfigurations can lead to data breaches. Cloud security for regulated industries Industries like healthcare, finance, and retail face strict regulations that require enhanced cloud security to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance. Cloud security for healthcare (HIPAA compliance) Healthcare organizations must comply with HIPAA, ensuring the protection of protected health information (PHI). This involves encrypting data, using strong authentication, and regularly auditing cloud environments. Private or hybrid cloud models are often used to maintain control over PHI and meet HIPAA requirements​. Cloud security for finance (PCI DSS compliance) Financial institutions must meet PCI DSS standards for handling payment data, which requires encryption, access controls, and monitoring. Financial firms often use hybrid clouds to balance scalability with strict data protection. Cloud security for retail (securing eCommerce) Retailers must secure customer payment data and comply with PCI DSS to prevent breaches during transactions. Public cloud services manage traffic, and encryption and CASBs ensure customer data is secure.

Watch Customer Story Video Top cloud security best practices Securing cloud environments requires a combination of technologies, policies, and proactive measures to protect data, applications, and infrastructure. Here are the top cloud security best practices to follow. Best Practice Description Tip Data EncryptionEncryption is essential to protect data both in transit and at rest. It ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read without the proper decryption keys. Strong encryption algorithms, such as AES-256, should be used for sensitive data, along with regular key management practices.Always encrypt sensitive data before uploading it to the cloud, and use cloud-native encryption tools for added security.Identity and Access ManagementImplementing IAM helps control who has access to cloud resources. By setting up role-based access control (RBAC) and MFA, organizations can limit access to authorized users only.Regularly review and update IAM policies to ensure users only have access to the resources they need.Continuous Monitoring and Threat DetectionCloud environments should be continuously monitored for suspicious activity and potential threats. Using CSPM tools, organizations can detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in real time.Set up automated alerts for abnormal behavior and use AI-driven tools for faster detection and response.Incident ResponseAn incident response plan is essential for minimizing the impact of security breaches. It should outline the steps for identifying, containing, and recovering from an attack in the cloud environment.Regularly test and update your incident response plan to ensure it is effective during a real-world attack. By following these best practices, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of cloud security breaches while maintaining compliance and protecting sensitive data. Building a cloud security governance framework A cloud security governance framework ensures that security policies, roles, and responsibilities are clearly defined and implemented across cloud environments. This is critical for maintaining control over data, reducing risks, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations. What is cloud governance? Cloud governance involves creating a structured set of policies and controls to manage cloud security effectively. It covers key areas like data management, risk management, and compliance. Without a strong governance framework, organizations risk losing visibility over their cloud infrastructure, leading to misconfigurations and security gaps. Key components of a cloud governance framework A cloud security governance framework establishes policies to manage data security, access control, compliance, and monitoring across cloud environments. It ensures sensitive data is protected through encryption and proper access management, using tools like DSPM and CIEM to enforce privacy and least privilege access. Additionally, regular audits are necessary to maintain compliance with industry standards such as PCI DSS and ISO 27001. Continuous monitoring and incident response plans help detect and mitigate threats in real time using AI-driven tools​. This unified approach is crucial, especially in complex multi-cloud or hybrid environments. Expert Tip Cloud environments often involve complex multi-cloud or hybrid setups, making governance challenging. A unified governance strategy is needed to avoid inconsistent security practices across different cloud platforms. By building a comprehensive cloud security governance framework, organizations can manage risks, maintain control over cloud resources, and ensure compliance with industry standards.

Challenges and Requirements Industrial companies need strong OT cybersecurity to deal with today’s sophisticated threats. Get recommendations for safe, reliable operations. 2025 State of OT & Cybersecurity Report 2025 THREAT LANDSCAPE REPORT Definition Challenges Requirements Implementation FAQs Definition Definition Challenges Requirements Implementation FAQs Definition of IoT Security IoT security is based on a cybersecurity strategy to protect IoT devices and the vulnerable networks they connect to from cyber attacks. IoT devices have no built-in security. IoT security is needed to help prevent data breaches because IoT devices transfer data over the internet unencrypted and operate undetected by standard cybersecurity systems. Along with the meaning of IoT Security, it is important to understand the many challenges facing enterprises when dealing with IoT security issues. IoT devices were not built with security in mind. The ongoing proliferation and diversity of IoT devices and communications channels  increases the potential for your organization to be exposed to cyber threats. Unfortunately, there is no way to install security software on most IoT devices. IoT devices may even ship with malware on them that infects the network when they connect. This is why network security is a priority for IoT security. Many network security solutions do not have the ability to detect connected IoT devices or show which devices are communicating on the network. The following sections explore these and other big IoT security challenges including: Weak authentication and authorization Lack of encryption Vulnerabilities in firmware and software Insecure communications Difficulty in patching and updating devices Weak authentication and authorization IoT devices often rely on weak authentication and authorization practices, which makes them vulnerable to threats. For example, many devices use default passwords making it easier for hackers to gain access to IoT devices and the networks they use for communication. In addition, rogue IoT devices (i.e., undetected) that are connected to the network can be used to steal data or launch attacks. Lack of encryption The overwhelming majority of IoT device network traffic is unencrypted making confidential and personal data vulnerable to a malware attack such as ransomware or other form of data breach or theft. This includes IoT devices used for medical imaging and patient monitoring, as well as security cameras and printers. Vulnerabilities in firmware and software The short development cycles and low price points of IoT devices limit the budget for developing and testing secure firmware. Without this built-in IoT security, IoT devices are vulnerable to the most rudimentary forms of attack. From firmware to software and third-party apps–millions of devices are affected by vulnerabilities in standard components. Plus, network environments can be compromised by vulnerable web apps and software for IoT devices. Whether it is a new threat or old malware, without IoT security, all types of vulnerabilities make IoT devices good targets for savvy bad actors to stage cyberattacks. Insecure communications protocols and channels IoT devices are often connected to the same network as other devices, which means that an attack on one device can spread to others. Lack of network segmentation and oversight of the ways IoT devices communicate makes them easier to intercept. For example, not long ago the automotive industry’s adoption of Bluetooth technology in IoT devices resulted in a wave of data breaches that made the news. As well, protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and API–are all channels that IoT devices rely on and cyber criminals exploit. For example, in 2022, millions of Buetooth digital locks in smart cars could be remotely unlocked by hackers exploiting a vulnerability in Bluetooth technology. As well, protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and API-are channels that IoT devices rely on and cyber criminals can exploit. Difficulty in patching and updating devices IoT manufacturers don’t focus on building IoT security into their devices to make hardware tamper proof and secure. Many IoT devices are not designed to receive regular IoT security updates, which makes them vulnerable to attacks. Without built-in IoT security it’s difficult to ensure secure upgrades, provide firmware updates and patches, and perform dynamic testing. Therefore, the onus is on the organization to protect its IoT devices and network environment from cyber threats. How to Use NERC-CIP: An Overview of the Standards and Their Deployment with Fortinet Discover how Fortinet can aid an organization in the process of maintaining compliance and key features that can help an organization's program during an audit. Download Now IoT Security Challenges The IoT attack surface expands every day as more and more devices come online–from our smartwatches and smart TVs, to our smart homes and smart cars, to the ever-growing industry IoT.  In addition to consumer goods, IoT sensors are widely used in healthcare, manufacturing, and supply chain operations, as well as for green agriculture, the economy, and national defense. Burgeoning IoT spans virtually any device or sensor that connects to the internet-from a large container on an ocean barge to a small Tile Tracker for your phone. To underscore, the IEEE IoT technology forecast of connected devices is expected to increase by about 300% from 8.7 billion devices in 2020 to more than 25 billion IoT devices in 2030. Given the expanded attack surface for security risks to availability, integrity and confidentiality, IoT security is critical for organizations to protect their network environments from IoT device-borne threats. How To Address IoT Security Requirements? IoT and security requirements can only be accomplished with an integrated solution that delivers visibility, segmentation, and protection throughout the entire network infrastructure, such as a holistic security fabric approach. Your IoT security must contain the following key abilities: Learn: With complete network visibility, security solutions can authenticate and classify IoT devices to build a risk profile and assign them to IoT device groups. Segment: Once the enterprise understands its IoT attack surface, IoT devices can be segmented into policy-driven groups based on their risk profiles. Protect: The policy-driven IoT groups and internal network segmentation enable monitoring, inspection, and policy enforcement based on the activity at various points within the infrastructure. Click to See Larger Image Understanding IoT Security Requirements IoT security requirements support an IoT security strategy that is specific to the business, industry, and network environment. There is a broad swath of protection to be considered in addition to the rigor of practicing administrative oversight, conducting regular patches and updates, enforcing use of strong passwords, and focusing on Wi-Fi security. Monitoring network and device behavior to detect deviations is a best practice to detect malware from an IoT device vulnerability.  Another best practice is network segmentation of IoT devices whereby they connect to a separate network to isolate vulnerable devices and threats to prevent malware from spreading across the enterprise. Applying zero-trust network access provides an additional layer of security. With the limited configuration capabilities of many IoT devices, instead of trying to secure the IoT firmware and software, you can protect your IoT environment with security solutions that provide multiple layers of protection including endpoint encryption. As the IoT and the cloud converge, consider securing the technologies with another layer of cloud-based security solutions that also add processing capabilities to devices at the edge. There are many different protocols used by IoT devices from internet protocols and network protocols to Bluetooth and other communications protocols. Understanding the protocols your devices use can help reduce security risks. Industries that rely on GPS for critical operations should monitor their GPS connected devices for potential security issues such as fake or jammed GPS signals. Conducting A Risk Assessment For IoT Devices And Systems Attackers prey on negligence. They take advantage of organizations that do not oversee IoT devices that are connected to the corporate network. These devices can include anything from  rogue devices to overlooked routers with outdated firmware. Understanding the risk of each device that is connected to your network and monitoring individual behavior is critical to prevent cyber attacks. Also essential to IoT security is maintaining a full inventory of networked devices on the corporate network. Finding a solution that can discover–in minutes–all the IoT connections within your network should be a top priority. Implementing Strong Authentication And Authorization Mechanism Authentication is one of the most crucial security measures for an engineer to consider in an IoT deployment. IT administrators can determine which IoT authentication and authorization type, such as one-way, two-way, or three-way, will serve the organization best based on the mechanism’s latency and data requirements. As mentioned above (e.g., default passwords), most IoT devices come with poor authentication. When deploying IoT devices, similar to websites and web apps, one of the best methods for IT admins to secure IoT devices is to use digital certificates. IoT device certificates are integral to an IoT security strategy. Ensuring Adequate Encryption And Secure Communications The primary purpose of encryption is to protect the confidentiality of digital data stored on computer systems or transmitted over the internet or any other computer network. IoT encryption is a key player in securing many different types of IoT devices. By encrypting data communications from IoT devices, an organization stands to gain confidentiality of contents, authentication of origin, data integrity, and awareness of the sender. Encryption is an effective way to secure data, but the cryptographic keys must be carefully managed to ensure data remains protected, yet accessible when needed. While IoT devices often are not targets themselves, without built-in security, they serve as attractive conduits for the distribution of malware that could result in a data breach. Data encryption is not a substitute for other information protection controls, such as physical access, authentication and authorization, or network access controls.  Data encryption is a method to reduce risk as is the practice of using secure communications protocols and channels for sensitive data. Although IoT devices are easy to deploy, their communication protocols must have the processing power, range, and reliability to run on existing internet infrastructure as called out in the criteria for IoT implementation (Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, etc.). It is important to consider power consumption when designing an IoT network. Low power wireless networks are best. For this reason, communication protocols created for IoT application requirements generally fall into two groups: Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) Wireless Personal Area Networking (WPAN) Securing Firmware And Software Updates With Patches Like other digital devices, IoT devices must be patched and updated to prevent threats from taking advantage of vulnerabilities in software and firmware. Installing updates and patching vulnerabilities is essential to IoT security as well as operational technology (OT). When devices cannot be patched or taken offline to prevent exploitation, administrators can deploy intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Partnering With IoT Security Experts For Effective Risk Management Managing IoT security on your network could be overwhelming without the help of IoT detection services and tools that discover IoT devices, block malicious traffic, and enable virtual patching. Detection is based on a local (installed) library of IoT devices that is regularly expanded and updated for the latest threats and vulnerabilities. Along with an IPS and network access control, detection services are integral to an IT security strategy for effective risk management. Which IoT Device Types Are Most Susceptible To Security Risks? Cyber attacks are used to exploit unprotected IoT devices with tactics such as network scanning, remote code execution, and command injection. The healthcare industry has the highest share of IoT security issues from internet connected devices used for medical imaging systems, patient monitoring systems, and medical device gateways. Another high-risk sector includes commonly used IoT devices such as security cameras and printers. Consumer electronics, IP phones, and energy management devices are also at higher risk. Examining The Top Industries Vulnerable To IoT Security Breaches Many industries have adopted IoT at the risk of higher exposure to cyber threats from vulnerabilities in IoT devices. Some industries are more vulnerable than others due to the sensitive nature of their data (e.g., medical records, autonomous vehicles, or intellectual property). These include large organizations with complex networks, digital factories and plants that rely on industrial operational technology (OT), and healthcare organizations that use medical IoT for patient care such as networked scanners, monitoring tools, wearable devices, and other internet connected systems. IoT devices are not built to meet the business and regulatory requirements of critical industries.

IoT security FAQs close IoT security is the practice of protecting internet-connected devices and the systems they rely on from unauthorized access, misuse, and disruption. It addresses vulnerabilities introduced by limited device controls, diverse connectivity methods, and inconsistent update mechanisms. Strong IoT security helps prevent device compromise, data exposure, and lateral movement within connected environments. Why is IoT security important? IoT security is important because internet-connected devices interact with physical systems and digital networks in ways that create new opportunities. And new vulnerabilities. These devices often operate with minimal controls. Yet they collect, transmit, and act on sensitive data in homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure. Without purpose-built security, IoT systems can be exploited to steal information, disrupt operations, or serve as entry points into larger networks. 81% of security leaders say their organizations experienced an IoT-focused attack in the past year. Organizations hit by IoT-targeted breaches were significantly more likely to face costs between $5M–$10M than those hit by traditional IT attacks. 46% of organizations still struggle to gain visibility into their IoT devices, making risk management extremely difficult. - Palo Alto Networks & Starfleet Research, ​​The 2024 Benchmark Report on IoT Security Not to mention, new use cases emerge faster than security models can adapt. As artificial intelligence becomes more embedded in IoT ecosystems—enhancing threat detection, trust management, and device decision-making—it also introduces new attack surfaces that further raise the stakes for securing connected environments. Plus, many devices remain deployed long after their support lifecycles end. | Further reading: What Is Cyber-Physical Systems Security (CPSSEC)? | Overview What are the primary IoT security risks and challenges? IoT environments introduce risk in ways that traditional IT systems don't. Many devices operate outside the reach of standard controls. They're physically exposed. They have limited compute resources. And they're often deployed without clear ownership or long-term support. That's what makes IoT security difficult. It's not just about technology. It's about how these devices are built, deployed, and managed across environments that may not be built for oversight. Here's where the biggest challenges show up: Many IoT devices are underpowered. They lack the processing capacity to run traditional security software or encrypt traffic reliably. And they often ship with weak defaults, insecure firmware, or hardcoded credentials that never get changed. There's also no standardization. Devices come from different vendors, run different software, and use different communication protocols. That makes it hard to apply consistent policies or updates across a fleet. 91% of security leaders say IoT device manufacturers do a poor job securing devices from attack. Manufacturers are projected to increase their use of OT assets by 400% by 2030—most of which were not designed for secure internet connectivity. - Palo Alto Networks & Starfleet Research, ​​The 2024 Benchmark Report on IoT Security And then there's the lifecycle problem. Devices stay in use long after their support ends. Or worse, with no support policy at all. Updates are rare. Patch management is nearly impossible. So vulnerabilities linger. Physical risk matters too. Unlike IT assets locked in data centers, many IoT devices are deployed in the open. Think parking meters, industrial sensors, or consumer gadgets. If an attacker can get to the device, they may be able to bypass software protections entirely. Visibility is another challenge. Many IoT devices are invisible to IT teams. They don't show up in inventory. They aren't monitored. And they may not even be known to security staff. Until something goes wrong. What happens when these gaps are exploited? Devices get compromised and used as entry points into larger systems. Sensitive data is exposed through unencrypted traffic or weak authentication. Attackers issue commands or take unauthorized control. Lateral movement enables deeper access across networks. Devices are hijacked into botnets and used in large-scale DDoS attacks. Supply chain issues introduce hidden vulnerabilities through third-party firmware or components. Ultimately, securing IoT means addressing both the limitations of the devices and the realities of how they're deployed. | Further reading: What Is the Difference Between IoT and OT Security? Which IoT devices and industries are most vulnerable? Not all IoT environments carry the same level of risk. Some devices are inherently more vulnerable—because of how they're built, where they're deployed, or whether they can be updated and monitored. And some industries rely more heavily on these devices in critical or distributed systems. Basically, the riskiest devices often show up in the riskiest places. Here's a breakdown of high-risk device types and where they tend to appear. High-risk IoT devices and where they're commonly deployed Device type Example use Why it's vulnerable Common in Consumer electronics Smart TVs, voice assistants, doorbells Weak defaults and rare security updates Homes, retail environments Home networking gear Wi-Fi routers, range extenders Often misconfigured or unmanaged by end users Residential, small business Security systems Networked cameras, smart locks Exposed to the internet and often lack strong authentication Government, commercial, infrastructure Healthcare devices Monitors, wearables, infusion pumps Handle sensitive data with limited ability to patch or monitor remotely Hospitals, elder care, telehealth Industrial control Sensors, PLCs, automation units Long lifespans and limited tamper protections Manufacturing, utilities, energy Connected vehicles GPS trackers, infotainment systems High mobility, long update cycles, and external network exposure Transportation, logistics, consumer Public infrastructure Utility meters, traffic systems, surveillance Distributed, physically accessible, and often lack IT-level asset management Cities, municipalities, critical infrastructure Retail / public kiosks Smart vending machines, self-checkouts Run on outdated platforms and are physically exposed Retail, transit, quick-service locations How does IoT security work? IoT security works by layering protections across the entire device lifecycle. It starts with provisioning: assigning identities, applying secure configurations, and controlling initial access. From there, protections like encryption, authenticated updates, and behavior monitoring help maintain trust. Devices enforce local policies, log key events, and report on their own posture when possible. And if something goes wrong, recovery mechanisms help restore the device or safely remove it. Because many IoT systems can't rely on constant updates or central control, strong security depends on designing devices and environments that can defend, detect, and recover on their own. What are the essential elements of IoT security? There's no single control that makes an IoT device secure. Security depends on a combination of protections. Each focused on a different aspect of the device's lifecycle, functionality, and environment. You need a full stack of coordinated elements that work together to defend against compromise, maintain operational integrity, and support secure management. Device identification: Each device should have unique logical and physical identifiers to support asset tracking, access control, and monitoring. Secure configuration: Devices must support authorized configuration changes and reject unauthorized ones. Secure defaults and restore points are important. Data protection: Confidentiality and integrity must be maintained for data at rest and in transit. Encryption and secure key management are essential. Logical access control: Only authorized users, services, or systems should be able to interact with the device. Role- or attribute-based policies help limit misuse. Software and firmware updates: Devices should accept only authenticated, integrity-checked updates. Signed firmware and code verification are critical. Event logging and monitoring: Security events like access attempts, config changes, and anomalies should be logged to support detection, investigation, and compliance. Device recovery: Compromised or malfunctioning devices should support restoration to a known-good state or allow for secure data wiping. Device provisioning and deprovisioning: Devices should support secure onboarding with identity validation and configuration enforcement. Deprovisioning should revoke access and erase data. Physical security: Devices in exposed locations should include tamper resistance and protections against key or firmware extraction. Cyber resilience: Devices should maintain safe operations under attack, including denial-of-service resistance and degraded-mode functionality. Secure communications: All network communications should be encrypted and authenticated. Devices must avoid transmitting sensitive data over insecure channels. Trustworthiness and attestation: Devices should be able to report on their own security posture, software state, and configuration integrity to support trust decisions. Policy enforcement: Devices should enforce local rules such as access limits, rate controls, or usage restrictions based on their role and conditions. What frameworks, standards, and regulations guide IoT security? Several frameworks and standards help guide how organizations approach IoT security. Some apply broadly across devices and industries. Others are tailored to specific contexts—like consumer products or industrial systems. Here's a quick overview of the most relevant ones: IoT security frameworks, standards, and regulations Name Type Description Applies to NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Framework Provides voluntary, high-level guidance for managing cybersecurity risk.

Download eBook IoT security FAQs What is meant by IoT security? IoT security is the practice of protecting internet-connected devices and their systems from unauthorized access, misuse, or disruption. What are the three types of IoT security? You can think of IoT security as falling into three broad categories: Device security – focuses on protecting the device itself (firmware, access control, physical hardening).Network security – ensures secure communication and prevents unauthorized access or data interception.Operational security – covers monitoring, updates, lifecycle management, and response to threats across the IoT ecosystem. What are the 4 levels of IoT security? While there’s no universal model, a practical way to view IoT security is in four progressive levels: Visibility – knowing what devices are on your network.Control – enforcing configuration, access, and communication policies.Protection – applying encryption, authentication, and segmentation.Resilience – ensuring systems can detect, respond, and recover from compromise. Why do we need IoT security? IoT devices introduce new risks due to their connectivity, limited protections, and interaction with physical systems. Security is essential to prevent data loss, operational disruption, and lateral attacks. What is the primary concern in IoT security? The main concern is that IoT devices are often poorly secured yet deeply embedded in critical systems, making them easy targets for attackers and hard to manage securely. What is the biggest security concern in IoT? Device compromise is one of the biggest concerns. It can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, lateral movement, or control of critical systems. Which methods are used in IoT security? Common methods include device identification, secure configuration, encrypted communications, access control, signed updates, monitoring, and segmentation.

The rise in digital cyberattacks has made cybersecurity a priority for businesses and individuals. For businesses, cybercrimes can lead to financial loss, operational disruption, data breaches, and a loss of trust, while individuals face identity theft, financial fraud, and privacy invasion. Read Cyber Threat Trends Report What is cybersecurity all about? Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. A successful cybersecurity posture has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, a unified threat management gateway system can automate integrations across products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation. People, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyberattacks. Take our free Introduction to Cybersecurity course People Users must understand and comply with basic data protection and privacy security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and backing up data. Learn more about basic cybersecurity principles from these Top 10 Cyber Tips (PDF). Processes Organizations must have a framework for how they deal with both attempted and successful cyberattacks. One well-respected model, the NIST cybersecurity framework, can guide you. It explains how you can identify attacks, protect systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover from successful attacks. Technology Technology is essential to giving organizations and individuals the computer security tools needed to protect themselves from cyberattacks. Three main entities must be protected: endpoint devices like computers, smart devices, and routers; networks; and the cloud. Common technology used to protect these entities include next-generation firewalls, Domain Name System (DNS) filtering, malware protection, antivirus software, and email security solutions. Why is cybersecurity important? In today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cybersecurity solutions. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning. Everyone also benefits from the work of cyberthreat researchers, like the team of 250 threat researchers at Talos, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyberattack strategies. They reveal new vulnerabilities, educate the public on the importance of cybersecurity, and strengthen open-source tools. Their work makes the internet safer for everyone.

Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files will be recovered or the system restored. Stop ransomware in its tracks Social engineering Social engineering is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Attackers can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data. Social engineering can be combined with any of the threats mentioned above to make you more likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source. Read more about social engineering tactics Threat detection An effective extended detection and response (XDR) system integrates solutions across the security stack, making it easier for analysts to focus on comprehensive threat detection, prioritize incident response, and improve productivity. With more visibility and context into data security threats, events that would not have been addressed before will surface to a higher level of awareness, thus allowing cybersecurity teams to quickly eliminate any further impact and reduce the severity and scope of the attack. Read more about XDR | Cisco XDR Zero trust Zero trust isn't a single product or technology. It's a security strategy that is best implemented by keeping an organization's business operations, risks, and security outcomes in mind. Although there are various paths to achieving zero trust maturity, most organizations prioritize deployment of technologies such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), device posture checks, zero trust network access (ZTNA), and network segmentation as they implement zero-trust security.

Implementing safe cybersecurity best practices is important for individuals as well as organizations of all sizes. Using strong passwords, updating your software, thinking before you click on suspicious links, and turning on multi-factor authentication are the basics of what we call “cyber hygiene” and will drastically improve your online safety. These cybersecurity basics apply to both individuals and organizations. For both government and private entities, developing and implementing tailored cybersecurity plans and processes is key to protecting and maintaining business operations. As information technology becomes increasingly integrated with all aspects of our society, there is increased risk for wide scale or high-consequence events that could cause harm or disrupt services upon which our economy and the daily lives of millions of Americans depend.In light of the risk and potential consequences of cyber events, CISA strengthens the security and resilience of cyberspace, an important homeland security mission.

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting people, systems and data from cyberattacks by using various technologies, processes and policies. At the enterprise level, cybersecurity is key to overall risk management strategy, and specifically, cyber risk management. Common cybersecurity threats include ransomware and other malware, phishing scams, data theft and more recently, attacks powered by artificial intelligence (AI). As cyberthreats grow in sophistication and frequency, organizations are increasing their investments in prevention and mitigation. The International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that security spending will reach USD 377 billion by 2028.1 Cybersecurity Trends for 2025 and Beyond (16:55 min) This evolving threat landscape has also fueled growth in the cybersecurity job market. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that “employment of information security analysts is projected to grow 32% from 2022 to 2032, faster than the average for all occupations.”2 Think Newsletter Would your team catch the next zero-day in time?

Cyberattacks and cybercrime can disrupt, damage and destroy businesses, communities and lives. Security incidents can lead to identity theft, extortion and the loss of sensitive information, impacts that can significantly affect businesses and the economy. By one estimate, cybercrime will cost the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.3 But a more pertinent question may be: “Why is cybersecurity especially important right now?” Today, cybercriminals are using new technologies to their advantage. For instance, businesses are embracing cloud computing for efficiency and innovation. But bad actors view this advancement as an expanding attack surface ripe for exploitation. Bad actors are also leveraging the dark web. According to the IBM X-Force 2025 Threat Intelligence Index, sophisticated threat actors, including nation-states, are using the anonymity of the dark web to acquire new tools and resources. They are demonstrating never-before-seen levels of coordination, automation and prowess—elevating risk from data breaches to widescale disruption. The cost of cyberattacks is also growing. According to IBM's latest Cost of a Data Breach Report: Average costs: The average cost of a data breach jumped to USD 4.88 million from USD 4.45 million in 2023, a 10% spike and the highest increase since the pandemic. Business losses: Business losses and post-breach response costs rose nearly 11% over the previous year. Regulatory fines: The number of organizations paying more than USD 50,000 in regulatory fines because of a data breach rose 22.7% over the previous year; those paying more than USD 100,000 rose 19.5%. Tech trends driving cyber threats One of the biggest challenges for cybersecurity professionals and security operations teams is the constantly evolving nature of the information technology (IT) landscape, and the evolving threats alongside it. Emerging technologies, while offering tremendous advantages for businesses and individuals, also present new opportunities for threat actors and cybercriminals to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks on critical systems. For example: Cloud computing On-demand access to computing resources can increase network management complexity and raise the risk of cloud misconfigurations, improperly secured APIs and other avenues hackers can exploit. Multicloud environments A multicloud approach introduces risks such as increased attack surface, identity access management gaps, cloud sprawl, fragmented security capabilities and heightened risk of human error or misconfiguration. Distributed work Remote work, hybrid work and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies mean more connections, devices, applications and data for security teams to protect—and for threat actors to exploit. The Internet of Things (IoT) Many connected devices—vehicles, appliances, and other physical objects—within IoT networks are unsecured or improperly secured by default and can be easily hijacked by bad actors. Artificial intelligence Generative AI in particular is a new threat landscape already exploited through methods such as prompt injection. However, research from the IBM Institute for Business Value says only 24% of generative AI initiatives are secured. Securing generative AI: What matters now A rising challenge: The cybersecurity skills gap As the global attack surface expands, the cybersecurity workforce is struggling to keep pace. A World Economic Forum study found that the gap between available cybersecurity workers and jobs that need to be filled could reach 85 million by 2030.4 Closing this skills gap can have a big impact. According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report, organizations experiencing a high-level shortage of security skills faced an average breach cost of USD 5.74 million, compared to USD 3.98 million for those with lower-level skills shortages. To address these challenges, resource-strained security teams will increasingly turn to security technologies featuring advanced analytics, AI and automation to strengthen cyber defenses and minimize the impact of successful attacks.

New episodes on Wednesdays at 6am EST. Watch the latest podcast episode The different types of cybersecurity Effective cybersecurity includes layers of protections across an organization’s IT infrastructure. Some of the most important types of cybersecurity include: AI securityCritical infrastructure securityNetwork securityEndpoint securityApplication securityCloud securityInformation securityIdentity security AI security In this context, AI security refers to cybersecurity measures designed to protect AI applications and systems from cyberthreats, cyberattacks and malicious use. Hackers might use prompt injection, data poisoning or other malicious techniques to trick AI tools into sharing confidential information. They also use AI itself to quickly create malicious code and phishing scam content. The term “AI security” can also mean using AI to enhance an organization's security posture (see “What is AI security?”). Critical infrastructure security Critical infrastructure security protects the computer systems, applications, networks, data and digital assets that a society depends on for national security, economic health and public safety. In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a cybersecurity framework to help IT providers and stakeholders secure critical infrastructure.5 The US Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also provides guidance.6 Network security Network security focuses on preventing unauthorized access to computer networks and systems. It has three chief aims: to prevent unauthorized access; to detect and stop in progress cyberattacks and security breaches; and to ensure that authorized users have secure access to their network resources. Endpoint security Endpoint security protects end users and endpoint devices—desktops, laptops, mobile devices, smartphones, servers and others—against cyberattacks. Organizations are also adopting unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions that allow them to protect, configure and manage all endpoint devices from a single console. Application security Application security (AppSec) works to identify and repair vulnerabilities in application software to prevent unauthorized access, modification or misuse. Modern application development methods (such as DevOps and DevSecOps) build security and security testing into the development process. Cloud security Cloud security secures an organization’s cloud-based infrastructure, including applications, data and virtual servers. Generally, cloud security operates on the shared responsibility model. The cloud provider is responsible for securing their delivered services and the infrastructure that delivers them. The customer is responsible for protecting customer data, code and other assets they store or run in the cloud. Information security Information security (InfoSec) protects an organization’s important information (digital files and data, paper documents, physical media) against unauthorized access, use or alteration. Data security, the protection of digital information, is a subset of information security and the focus of most cybersecurity-related InfoSec measures. Identity security Identity security focuses on protecting digital identities and the systems that manage them. It includes practices such as identity verification, access control enforcement and unauthorized access prevention. According to the IBM X-Force 2025 Threat Intelligence Index, identity-based attacks make up 30% of total intrusions—making identity-based attacks the most common entry point into corporate networks. What are the most common types of cyber threats? Today, the most common types of cyberattacks and cybersecurity threats include: MalwareRansomwarePhishing attacksCredential theft and abuseInsider threatsAI attacksCryptojackingDistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) Malware Malware, short for \"malicious software,\" is any software code or computer program that is intentionally written to harm a computer system or its end users, such as Trojan horses and spyware. Almost every modern cyberattack involves some type of malware. Ransomware Ransomware is a type of malware that holds a victim’s sensitive data or device hostage, threatening to keep it locked—or worse—unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker. Since 2023, ransomware attacks have been on the decline. The decline is likely due to businesses’ reluctance to pay ransoms and increased government actions against ransomware groups. Phishing Phishing is a type of social engineering that uses fraudulent email, text or voice messages to trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information or sending funds to the wrong people. Bulk phishing scams are most familiar—mass-mailed fraudulent messages that appear to be from a trusted brand, asking recipients to reset their passwords or reenter credit card information. More sophisticated phishing scams, such as spear phishing and business email compromise (BEC), target specific individuals or groups to steal especially valuable data or large sums of money. Credential theft and account abuse Hackers have many techniques for stealing credentials and taking over accounts. For example, Kerberoasting attacks manipulate the Kerberos authentication protocol (commonly used in Microsoft Active Directory) to seize privileged service accounts. In 2025, the IBM X-Force team identified a surge in phishing emails distributing infostealer malware and credential phishing. Insider threats Insider threats originate with authorized users (employees, contractors or business partners) who intentionally or accidentally misuse their legitimate access or have their accounts hijacked by cybercriminals. These threats can be difficult to detect because they have the earmarks of authorized activity and are invisible to antivirus software, firewalls and other security solutions that block external attacks. AI attacks Cybercriminals are using AI to conduct advanced attacks. Some use open source generative AI to produce fake emails, applications and other business documents in minutes. Hackers are also using organizations’ AI tools as attack vectors. For example, in prompt injection attacks, threat actors use malicious inputs to manipulate generative AI systems into leaking sensitive data, spreading misinformation or worse. Cryptojacking Cryptojacking occurs when hackers gain access to a device and use its computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero. Security analysts identified cryptojacking as a cyberthreat around 2011, shortly after the introduction of cryptocurrency. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) A DDoS attack attempts to crash an online resource—such as a website or cloud service— by overloading it with traffic. This is typically performed using a botnet, a network of distributed systems that a cybercriminal hijacks by using malware and remote-controlled operations. Increasingly, attackers are combining DDoS attacks with ransomware attacks, or simply threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless the target pays a ransom. Common cybersecurity myths Despite an ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity incidents worldwide and the insights gleaned from resolving these incidents, some cybersecurity misconceptions persist. Some of the most dangerous include: Strong passwords are adequate protectionMost cybersecurity risks are well-knownAll cyberattack vectors are containedSome industries are safe from riskCybercriminals don’t attack small businesses Myth #1: Strong passwords are adequate protection Strong passwords do make a difference—a 12-character password takes 62 trillion times longer to crack than a 6-character one. But passwords are also easy to acquire, through social engineering, keylogging malware or buying them on the dark web (or off disgruntled insiders). Myth #2: Most cybersecurity risks are well-known The cyberthreat landscape is constantly changing. Thousands of new vulnerabilities are reported every year. Opportunities for human error, specifically by negligent employees or contractors who unintentionally cause a data breach, are also increasing. Myth #3: All cyberattack vectors are contained Cybercriminals find new attack vectors all the time. The rise of AI technologies, operational technology (OT), IoT devices and cloud environments all give hackers new opportunities to cause trouble. Myth #4: Some industries are safe from risk Every industry faces cybersecurity risks. For example, ransomware attacks are targeting more sectors than ever, including local governments, nonprofits and healthcare providers. Attacks on supply chains, government (.gov) websites and critical infrastructure have also increased. Myth #5: Cybercriminals don’t attack small businesses Yes, they do. The Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report found that almost half (41%) of small businesses in the US experienced a cyberattack in the last year.7 Cybersecurity best practices While each organization’s security strategy differs, many use these tools and tactics to reduce vulnerabilities, prevent attacks and intercept attacks in progress: Cybersecurity awareness trainingData security toolsIdentity and access managementAttack surface managementThreat detection and responseDisaster recovery Cybersecurity awareness training With robust data security policies, security awareness training can help employees protect personal and organizational data. For example, it can help users understand how seemingly harmless actions—oversharing on social media or ignoring operating system updates—can increase risk of attack. It can also help them recognize and avoid phishing and malware attacks. Data security tools Data security tools can help stop security threats in progress or mitigate their effects. For instance, data loss prevention (DLP) tools can detect and block attempted data theft, while security controls like encryption can enhance data protection by making any data that hackers do manage to steal useless. Identity and access management Identity and access management (IAM) refers to the tools and strategies that control how users access digital resources and what they can do with those resources. For example, multifactor authentication (MFA) requires users to supply multiple credentials to log in, meaning threat actors need more than just a password to break into an account. A zero trust security architecture is one way to enforce strict access controls. Attack surface management Attack surface management (ASM) is the continuous discovery, analysis, remediation and monitoring of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that make up an organization’s attack surface. Unlike other cyberdefense disciplines, ASM is conducted entirely from a hacker’s perspective. Threat detection and response Analytics- and AI-driven technologies can help identify and respond to attacks in progress. These technologies can include security information and event management (SIEM), security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) and endpoint detection and response (EDR). Typically, organizations use these technologies as part of a formal incident response plan. Disaster recovery Disaster recovery capabilities play a key role in maintaining business continuity and remediating threats in the event of a cyberattack. For example, the ability to fail over to a backup hosted in a remote location can help businesses resume operations after a ransomware attack (sometimes without paying a ransom).

Key takeaways Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting your critical systems, data, and networks from digital attacks.As data has proliferated and more people work and connect from anywhere, bad actors have developed sophisticated methods for gaining access to resources and data. An effective cybersecurity program includes people, processes, and technology solutions to reduce the risk of business disruption, data theft, financial loss, and reputational damage from an attack. Cybersecurity is essential for safeguarding against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threat. Understanding cybersecurity What is cybersecurity? As data has proliferated and more people work and connect from anywhere, bad actors have responded by developing a broad array of expertise and skills. Every year the number of cyberattacks increases as adversaries continue to evolve their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) and scale their operations. This ever-evolving threat landscape necessitates that organizations create a dynamic, ongoing cybersecurity program to stay resilient and adapt to emerging risks. An effective cybersecurity program includes people, processes, and technology solutions to reduce the risk of business disruption, data theft, financial loss, and reputational damage from an attack. Types of cybersecurity threats Bad actors continuously evolve their TTPs to evade detection and exploit vulnerabilities using a myriad of attack methods, including: Malware—like viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware Malware is a catchall term for any malicious software, including worms, ransomware, spyware, and viruses. It is designed to cause harm to computers or networks by altering or deleting files, extracting sensitive data like passwords and account numbers, or sending malicious emails or traffic. Malware may be installed by an attacker who gains access to the network, but often, individuals unwittingly deploy malware on their devices or company network after clicking on a bad link or downloading an infected attachment. Malware is often used to establish a foothold in a network, creating a backdoor that lets cyberattackers move laterally within the system. It can also be used to steal data or encrypt files in ransomware attacks. Phishing and social engineering attacks In social engineering, attackers take advantage of people’s trust to dupe them into handing over account information or downloading malware. In these attacks, bad actors masquerade as a known brand, coworker, or friend and use psychological techniques such as creating a sense of urgency to get people to do what they want. Phishing is a type of social engineering that uses emails, text messages, or voicemails that appear to be from a reputable source and ask users to click on a link that requires them to login—allowing the attacker to steal their credentials. Some phishing campaigns are sent to a huge number of people in the hope that one person will click. Other campaigns, called spear phishing, are more targeted and focus on a single person. For example, an adversary might pretend to be a job seeker to trick a recruiter into downloading an infected resume. More recently, AI has been used in phishing scams to make them more personalized, effective, and efficient, which makes them harder to detect. Ransomware Ransomware, also known as cyber extortion, is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's data and demands payment (often in cryptocurrency) to restore access. Cyber extortion can have devastating financial and reputational consequences for businesses and individuals. There are two main types of ransomware attacks: commodity-based ransomware and human-operated ransomware. Commodity-based attacks are typically automated and indiscriminate, targeting a wide range of victims using mass-distributed malware. In contrast, human-operated ransomware is a more targeted approach where attackers manually infiltrate and navigate networks, often spending weeks in systems to maximize the impact and potential payout of the attack. Identity threats Identity threats involve malicious efforts to steal or misuse personal or organizational identities that allow the attacker to access sensitive information or move laterally within the network. Brute force attacks are attempts to guess passwords by trying many combinations. Credential theft occurs when attackers steal login details, often through phishing, allowing them to login as an authorized user and access accounts and sensitive inform. Business email compromise Business email compromise is a type of is a type of phishing attack where an attacker compromises the email of a legitimate business or trusted partner and sends phishing emails posing as a senior executive attempting to trick employees into transferring money or sensitive data to them. Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks A DoS attack seeks to overwhelm a system or network, making it unavailable to users. DDoS attacks use multiple devices to flood a target with traffic, causing service interruptions or complete shutdowns. Advance persistent threats (APTs) APTs involve attackers gaining unauthorized access to a network and remaining undetected for extended periods. ATPs are also known as multistage attacks, and are often carried out by nation-state actors or established threat actor groups. Their goal is to steal data or sabotage the system over time, often targeting governments or large corporations. ATPs employ multiple other types of attacks—including phishing, malware, identity attacks—to gain access. Human-operated ransomware is a common type of APT. Insider threats Insider threats come from individuals within an organization who either accidentally or maliciously compromise security. These threats may arise from disgruntled employees or those with access to sensitive information. This can include an employee downloading data to share with a competitor or accidentally sending sensitive data without encryption over a compromised channel. Threat actors Who are we defending against? Understanding the motivations and profiles of attackers is essential in developing effective cybersecurity defenses. Some of the key adversaries in today’s threat landscape include: Nation-state sponsored actors A nation-state sponsored actor is a group or individual that is supported by a government to conduct cyberattacks against other countries, organizations, or individuals. State-sponsored cyberattackers often have vast resources and sophisticated tools at their disposal. Their motivations can range from espionage to destabilizing infrastructure, with attacks often targeting governments, critical infrastructure, and corporations. Nation-state sponsored actors are typically the most well-resourced and effective type of attacker. They sometimes sell their tooling to smaller groups. Ransomware groups These organized criminal groups deploy ransomware to extort businesses for financial gain. They are typically leading sophisticated, multistage hands-on-keyboard attacks that steal data and disrupt business operations, demanding hefty ransom payments in exchange for decryption keys. Cyber mercenaries/private sector offensive actors Cyber mercenaries are hackers for hire who offer their services to governments, corporations, or criminal organizations. They conduct espionage, sabotage, or other malicious activities on behalf of their clients. Frameworks and standards Cybersecurity frameworks and standards Organizations rely on well-established frameworks and standards to guide their cybersecurity efforts. Some of the most widely adopted frameworks include:   NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), this framework provides guidelines for managing and reducing cybersecurity risk. ISO/IEC 27001: A global standard for managing information security that outlines a systematic approach to securing sensitive data. CIS Controls: The Center for Internet Security's critical security controls offer a set of best practices for defending against cyber threats. Importance of compliance and regulatory requirements: Regulatory bodies mandate certain security measures for organizations handling sensitive data. Non-compliance can result in legal consequences and fines. Adhering to well-established frameworks helps ensure organizations protect customer data and avoid regulatory penalties. Choosing the right framework for your organization: Selecting the right cybersecurity framework depends on an organization's size, industry, and regulatory environment. Organizations should consider their risk tolerance, compliance requirements, and security needs and choose a framework that aligns with their goals. Tools and technologies Cybersecurity tools and technologies To defend against modern cyber threats, organizations need a multi-layered defense strategy that employs various tools and technologies, including: Endpoint Protection and antivirus software Endpoint protection software secures individual devices (laptops, smartphones, etc.) against malware, ransomware, and other threats. Antivirus software scans for and removes malicious software from devices. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Solutions IAM solutions help organizations control who has access to critical information and systems, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access sensitive resources. Firewalls and Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) Firewalls act as the first line of defense, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. IDPS systems detect and prevent intrusions by analyzing network traffic for signs of malicious activity. Cloud security Cloud security encompasses the technologies, procedures, policies, and controls that help you protect your cloud-based systems and data. Collaboration security Collaboration security is a framework of tools and practices designed to protect the exchange of information and workflows within digital workspaces like messaging apps, shared documents, and video conferencing platforms. It aims to safeguard against unauthorized access, data leaks, and cyber threats while enabling seamless collaboration among team members. Effective collaboration security ensures that employees can work together securely from anywhere, maintaining compliance and protecting sensitive information. Encryption and data protection tools Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Strong encryption is essential for protecting sensitive data, both in transit and at rest. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems SIEM systems collect and analyze security data from across an organization’s IT infrastructure, providing real-time insights into potential threats and helping with incident response. Extended detection and response (XDR) Extended detection and response, often abbreviated as XDR, is a unified security incident platform that uses AI and automation. It provides organizations with a holistic, efficient way to protect against and respond to advanced cyberattacks. Unified SecOps solution A Unified SecOps solution provides all the tools a security operations center needs to protect their organization. At minimum, a security operations platform should include an Extended Detection and Response (XDR), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration and Automated Response (SOAR), and some type of posture solution. While new, GenAI is also becoming an increasingly important component to the platform. Best practices Strategies and policies for cybersecurity Effective cybersecurity isn't just about technology; it requires a comprehensive approach that includes the following best practices: Implement a Zero Trust policy A Zero Trust approach assumes that no one—inside or outside the network—should be trusted by default. This means continuously verifying the identity of users and devices before granting access to sensitive data. Ensuring entire organization is aligned to Zero Trust policy It's essential for all employees, from leadership to entry-level, to understand and follow the organization's Zero Trust policy. This alignment reduces the risk of accidental breaches or malicious insider activity. Implementing a Robust Security Policy A well-defined security policy provides clear guidelines on how to protect information assets. This includes acceptable use policies, incident response plans, and protocols for managing sensitive data. Security hygiene, patch management, and software updates Regularly updating software and systems is critical for patching vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Security hygiene, such as strong password practices and regularly backing up data, further strengthens defenses. Regular security training and cybersecurity awareness programs Employees are often the first line of defense against cyberattacks. Regular training helps them recognize phishing attempts, social engineering tactics, and other potential threats. Conduct regular security audits and assessments Periodic security audits help identify weaknesses in an organization’s defenses. Conducting regular assessments ensures that the security infrastructure remains up-to-date and effective against evolving threats. Incident response planning and management An incident response plan prepares an organization to quickly and effectively respond to a cyberattack. This minimizes damage, ensures continuity of operations, and helps restore normalcy as quickly as possible. Case studies Case studies and real-world examples There’s no doubt that cybercrime is on the rise. Recent Microsoft Entra data shows that attempted password attacks have increased to 4,000 per second on average. In 2023, human-operated ransomware attacks increased 195%. Preventing these and other security attacks often comes down to effective security hygiene. Regular software updates, patching, and password management are essential for reducing vulnerability. Basic practices like ensuring secure configurations and using up-to-date antivirus software significantly lower the risk of successful attacks. Implementing extended detection and response (XDR) significantly reduces risk. Security strategies like least privilege access and multi-factor authentication can mitigate many attack vectors. Emerging trends The future of cybersecurity The cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve with new threats and opportunities emerging, including: AI and machine learning AI, machine learning, and generative AI are transforming cybersecurity with real-time threat detection, automated incident response, and the ability to predict how potential vulnerabilities could be exploited in an attack.
